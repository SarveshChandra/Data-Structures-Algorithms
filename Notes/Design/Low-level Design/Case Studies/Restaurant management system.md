# Restaurant Management System

**Requirements**

1. The restaurant will have different branches.
2. Each restaurant branch will have a menu.
3. The menu will have different menu sections, containing different
menu items.
4. The waiter should be able to create an order for a table and add
meals for each seat.
5. Each meal can have multiple meal items. Each meal item
corresponds to a menu item.
6. The system should be able to retrieve information about tables
currently available to seat walk-in customers.
7. The system should support the reservation of tables.
8. The receptionist should be able to search for available tables by
date/time and reserve a table.
9. The system should allow customers to cancel their reservation.
10. The system should be able to send notifications whenever the
reservation time is approaching.
11. The customers should be able to pay their bills through credit card,
check or cash.
12. Each restaurant branch can have multiple seating arrangements of
tables.

Based on your requirements, we will need several classes to represent the different components of the system. Here's a high-level design for a restaurant management system:

1. `Restaurant` - Represents the entire restaurant, including its branches.
2. `Branch` - Represents a specific branch of the restaurant. Each branch has its own menu and table layout.
3. `Menu` - Represents the menu of a specific branch. It includes various `MenuSection` objects.
4. `MenuSection` - Represents a section of the menu (e.g., appetizers, main courses, desserts). It contains multiple `MenuItem` objects.
5. `MenuItem` - Represents a specific item on the menu.
6. `Table` - Represents a table in a specific branch of the restaurant. It has information about its current availability and reservation status.
7. `Reservation` - Represents a table reservation. It includes information about the customer who made the reservation and the date and time of the reservation.
8. `Order` - Represents an order made by a table. It contains multiple `Meal` objects, one for each seat at the table.
9. `Meal` - Represents a meal, which can include multiple `MealItem` objects.
10. `MealItem` - Represents a specific menu item included in a meal.
11. `Waiter` - Represents a waiter. A waiter can create orders for tables.
12. `Receptionist` - Represents a receptionist. A receptionist can make table reservations and handle table availability.
13. `Payment` - Represents a payment made by a customer. It could be by credit card, check, or cash.

Now, let's provide some sample Python code for these classes.

```python
class Restaurant:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.branches = []

class Branch:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.menu = Menu()
        self.tables = []
        self.waiters = []
        self.receptionists = []

class Menu:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sections = []

class MenuSection:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.items = []

class MenuItem:
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

class Table:
    def __init__(self, number, seats):
        self.number = number
        self.seats = seats
        self.reservation = None
        self.order = None

class Reservation:
    def __init__(self, customer_name, reservation_time):
        self.customer_name = customer_name
        self.reservation_time = reservation_time

class Order:
    def __init__(self, waiter):
        self.waiter = waiter
        self.meals = []

class Meal:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

class MealItem:
    def __init__(self, menu_item):
        self.menu_item = menu_item

class Waiter:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def create_order(self, table):
        table.order = Order(self)

class Receptionist:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def make_reservation(self, table, customer_name, reservation_time):
        table.reservation = Reservation(customer_name, reservation_time)

class Payment:
    def __init__(self, amount, method):
        self.amount = amount
        self.method = method
```

This code provides a basic outline of the structure of the classes required to meet the specified requirements. Methods would need to be added to handle additional actions, such as cancelling reservations, sending notifications, making payments, and updating table and meal status. 

Remember, this is a simplified design and might need enhancements based on additional needs, such as dealing with edge cases, security concerns, concurrency handling, and more.

For a more detailed and robust design, we can add more attributes and methods to our classes. For example, for handling payments, we could create separate classes for each type of payment method and use polymorphism. For handling notifications, we could use an Observer design pattern, and so on.

Let's see how we can enhance the classes:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from datetime import datetime

class Restaurant:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.branches = []

class Branch:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.menu = Menu()
        self.tables = []
        self.waiters = []
        self.receptionists = []

    def find_table(self, num_seats):
        # Return the first available table that can accommodate num_seats
        for table in self.tables:
            if table.is_available() and table.can_accommodate(num_seats):
                return table
        return None

class Menu:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sections = []

class MenuSection:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.items = []

class MenuItem:
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

class Table:
    def __init__(self, number, seats):
        self.number = number
        self.seats = seats
        self.reservation = None
        self.order = None

    def is_available(self):
        # Check if the table is available
        return self.order is None

    def can_accommodate(self, num_seats):
        # Check if the table can accommodate a certain number of seats
        return self.seats >= num_seats

class Reservation:
    def __init__(self, customer_name, reservation_time):
        self.customer_name = customer_name
        self.reservation_time = reservation_time

    def is_active(self):
        # Check if the reservation is still active
        return self.reservation_time > datetime.now()

class Order:
    def __init__(self, waiter):
        self.waiter = waiter
        self.meals = []

class Meal:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

class MealItem:
    def __init__(self, menu_item):
        self.menu_item = menu_item

class Waiter:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def create_order(self, table):
        if table.is_available():
            table.order = Order(self)
        else:
            print("Table is not available")

class Receptionist:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def make_reservation(self, table, customer_name, reservation_time):
        if table.is_available():
            table.reservation = Reservation(customer_name, reservation_time)
        else:
            print("Table is not available")

class PaymentMethod(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def make_payment(self, amount):
        pass

class CreditCardPayment(PaymentMethod):
    def make_payment(self, amount):
        print(f"Paid {amount} with credit card")

class CashPayment(PaymentMethod):
    def make_payment(self, amount):
        print(f"Paid {amount} with cash")

class CheckPayment(PaymentMethod):
    def make_payment(self, amount):
        print(f"Paid {amount} with check")

class Payment:
    def __init__(self, amount, method: PaymentMethod):
        self.amount = amount
        self.method = method

    def process_payment(self):
        self.method.make_payment(self.amount)
```

In this updated design:

- Each `Table` can check if it's currently available

 and whether it can accommodate a certain number of seats.
- Each `Order` is associated with a `Waiter` who created it.
- Each `Reservation` can check if it's still active.
- Payment is processed using different `PaymentMethod`s using the Strategy pattern.
- We separated the `Reservation` and `Order` from the `Table` class to enhance the single responsibility principle.

For sending notifications, you might want to add a `NotificationService` class that takes care of this, with different types of notifiers (SMS, email, etc.) Again, you can use the Strategy pattern for this. Also, for handling concurrency and to ensure data consistency, you could add a database with ACID properties and add transactions to critical parts of the system (such as making reservations and orders, and processing payments). 

This design can be further enhanced based on additional requirements, such as handling discounts or special offers, keeping track of waiter shifts, managing the inventory of ingredients in the kitchen, and so on.

Adding edge cases and data concurrency to our design would make it more robust and reliable. We can handle these by adding appropriate error checking, exception handling, and synchronization mechanisms.

Here are some scenarios and how we can handle them:

**Edge Cases:**

1. **Reservation conflicts**: There could be cases where two customers are trying to reserve the same table at the same time. To handle this, we could synchronize access to the table's reservation method so that only one reservation can be made at a time.

2. **Ordering items not on the menu**: A customer could try to order a meal item that isn't on the menu. To handle this, we can validate the meal item against the menu before adding it to the order.

3. **Paying with insufficient funds**: A customer could try to make a payment with insufficient funds. To handle this, we could add a check in the payment method to ensure that the customer has enough funds before making a payment.

4. **Booking a table that is not available**: A customer might try to book a table that isn't available. To prevent this, we can check the availability of the table before making a booking.

**Data Concurrency:**

1. **Simultaneous orders**: If two waiters try to place an order for the same table at the same time, without proper synchronization, the system might end up accepting both orders. This could be prevented by synchronizing access to the table's order creation method.

2. **Simultaneous payments**: If two payments are made for the same order at the same time, the system might double charge the customer. This could be prevented by synchronizing access to the order's payment processing method.

Here's how we could modify the `Table` and `Payment` classes to handle these scenarios:

```python
import threading

class Table:
    # ...
    _lock = threading.Lock()

    def make_reservation(self, reservation):
        with self._lock:
            if self.is_available():
                self.reservation = reservation
            else:
                raise Exception("Table is not available")

    def create_order(self, order):
        with self._lock:
            if self.is_available():
                self.order = order
            else:
                raise Exception("Table is not available")

class Payment:
    # ...
    _lock = threading.Lock()

    def process_payment(self):
        with self._lock:
            if self.amount > 0:
                self.method.make_payment(self.amount)
                self.amount = 0
            else:
                raise Exception("Payment has already been processed")
```

In these modified classes:

- Each `Table` uses a lock to synchronize access to its reservation and order methods.
- Each `Payment` uses a lock to synchronize access to its payment processing method.

Please note that proper error handling should be put in place to ensure that these exceptions are caught and handled appropriately. Also, this is a very simplistic view of concurrency and in real-world systems, concurrency control would likely be handled at the database level using transactions.
