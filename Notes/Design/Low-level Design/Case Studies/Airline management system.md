# Airline Management System

**Requirements**

1. Customers should be able to search for flights for a given date and
source/destination airport.
2. Customers should be able to reserve a ticket for any scheduled flight.
Customers can also build a multi-flight itinerary.
3. Users of the system can check flight schedules, their departure time,
available seats, arrival time, and other flight details.
4. Customers can make reservations for multiple passengers under one
itinerary.
5. Only the admin of the system can add new aircrafts, flights, and flight
schedules. Admin can cancel any pre-scheduled flight (all
stakeholders will be notified).
6. Customers can cancel their reservation and itinerary.
7. The system should be able to handle the assignment of pilots and
crew members to flights.
8. The system should be able to handle payments for reservations.
9. The system should be able to send notifications to customers
whenever a reservation is made/modified or there is an update for
their flights.

Sure, I'll provide an outline of classes and some of their methods that might be involved in a real airline management system based on your requirements.

1. **User**: Represents a system user, either a customer or an admin.
   - Attributes: userID, password, userType (admin or customer)
   - Methods: login(), logout()

2. **Customer**: Inherits from User, represents a customer.
   - Attributes: name, email, reservations (list of Reservation objects)
   - Methods: searchFlights(), createReservation(), cancelReservation()

3. **Admin**: Inherits from User, represents an admin.
   - Attributes: name, email
   - Methods: addAircraft(), addFlight(), cancelFlight()

4. **Flight**: Represents a flight.
   - Attributes: flightID, aircraft (Aircraft object), schedule (FlightSchedule object), origin, destination, seats (list of Seat objects), crewMembers (list of CrewMember objects)
   - Methods: getAvailableSeats(), assignCrew(), removeCrew()

5. **FlightSchedule**: Represents a flight schedule.
   - Attributes: departureTime, arrivalTime
   - Methods: updateSchedule()

6. **Aircraft**: Represents an aircraft.
   - Attributes: aircraftID, seats (list of Seat objects)
   - Methods: addSeat(), removeSeat()

7. **Seat**: Represents a seat on an aircraft.
   - Attributes: seatNumber, isAvailable
   - Methods: reserve(), cancel()

8. **Reservation**: Represents a reservation made by a customer.
   - Attributes: reservationID, customer (Customer object), flight (Flight object), seats (list of Seat objects), payment (Payment object)
   - Methods: addSeat(), removeSeat(), makePayment(), sendConfirmation()

9. **Payment**: Represents a payment made by a customer.
   - Attributes: paymentID, amount, paymentMethod, isPaid
   - Methods: makePayment(), refund()

10. **CrewMember**: Represents a crew member assigned to a flight.
    - Attributes: crewMemberID, name, assignedFlights (list of Flight objects)
    - Methods: assignToFlight(), removeFromFlight()

11. **NotificationService**: Service for sending notifications to customers.
    - Methods: sendNotification()

This is a simplified version of what an actual system might look like. In a real system, you'd also have to consider aspects like data persistence, error handling, security, concurrency, etc. Also, note that depending on the specifics of the project and the design choices made, the actual classes, their attributes and methods can vary.

Below is a basic implementation of these classes in Python. Please note that this is a simplified version and doesn't include aspects like data persistence, error handling, concurrency, security, etc. For brevity, I'll just include method signatures and simple print statements for most methods.

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, userID, password, userType):
        self.userID = userID
        self.password = password
        self.userType = userType

    def login(self):
        print("User logged in")

    def logout(self):
        print("User logged out")

class Customer(User):

        self.reservations = []

    def searchFlights(self):
        print("Customer is searching flights")

        self.seatNumber = seatNumber
        self.isAvailable = isAvailable

    def reserve(self):
        print("Reserving seat")

    def cancel(self):
        print("Canceling seat reservation")

class Reservation:
    def __init__(self, reservationID, customer, flight):
        self.reservationID = reservationID
        self.customer = customer
        self.flight = flight
        self.seats = []
        self.payment = None

    def addSeat(self):

class Payment:
    def __init__(self, paymentID, amount, paymentMethod):
        self.paymentID = paymentID
        self.amount = amount
        self.paymentMethod = paymentMethod
        self.isPaid = False

    def makePayment(self):
        print("Making payment")

    def refund(self):
        print("Refunding payment")

class CrewMember:
    def __init__(self, crewMemberID, name):
       

 self.crewMemberID = crewMemberID
        self.name = name
        self.assignedFlights = []

    def assignToFlight(self):
        print("Assigning crew member to flight")

    def removeFromFlight(self):
        print("Removing crew member from flight")

class NotificationService:
    @staticmethod
    def sendNotification():
        print("Sending notification")
```

You can fill out the method bodies according to your business logic.
