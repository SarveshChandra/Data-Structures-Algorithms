# Car Rental System

**Requirements**

1. The system will support the renting of different automobiles like
cars, trucks, SUVs, vans, and motorcycles.
2. Each vehicle should be added with a unique barcode and other
details, including a parking stall number which helps to locate the
vehicle.
3. The system should be able to retrieve information like which
member took a particular vehicle or what vehicles have been rented
out by a specific member.
4. The system should collect a late-fee for vehicles returned after the
due date.
5. Members should be able to search the vehicle inventory and reserve
any available vehicle.
6. The system should be able to send notifications whenever the
reservation is approaching the pick-up date, as well as when the
vehicle is nearing the due date or has not been returned within the
due date.
7. The system will be able to read barcodes from vehicles.
8. Members should be able to cancel their reservations.
9. The system should maintain a vehicle log to track all events related to
the vehicles.
10. Members can add rental insurance to their reservation.
11. Members can rent additional equipment, like navigation, child seat,
ski rack, etc.
12. Members can add additional services to their reservation, such as
roadside assistance, additional driver, wifi, etc.

Given your requirements, let's design a simplified car rental system. The main classes can be divided into:

1. **Vehicle**: A vehicle has properties such as barcode, vehicle type, parking stall number, availability, and a log for tracking its rental history.

2. **Rental**: This class represents a rental transaction and can track details such as the renter (Member), vehicle rented, start date, end date, insurance details, additional equipment rented, and any additional services.

3. **Member**: This represents a user of the system. A member can have properties such as name, email, address, and a log of their rental history.

4. **Inventory**: This represents the inventory of the rental company. It can keep track of all vehicles, allow for vehicles to be added and removed, and facilitate search and retrieval of vehicles.

5. **NotificationService**: This class handles the sending of notifications.

Here are the initial class designs based on the requirements:

```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, barcode, type, parking_stall):
        self.barcode = barcode
        self.type = type
        self.parking_stall = parking_stall
        self.is_available = True
        self.log = []

    def rent(self, member, start_date, end_date):
        self.is_available = False
        rental = Rental(member, self, start_date, end_date)
        self.log.append(rental)
        return rental

    def return_vehicle(self):
        self.is_available = True

class Rental:
    def __init__(self, member, vehicle, start_date, end_date):
        self.member = member
        self.vehicle = vehicle
        self.start_date = start_date
        self.end_date = end_date
        self.equipment = []
        self.services = []
        self.insurance = None

    def add_equipment(self, equipment):
        self.equipment.append(equipment)

    def add_service(self, service):
        self.services.append(service)

    def add_insurance(self, insurance):
        self.insurance = insurance

class Member:
    def __init__(self, name, email, address):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.address = address
        self.rental_history = []

    def rent_vehicle(self, vehicle, start_date, end_date):
        rental = vehicle.rent(self, start_date, end_date)
        self.rental_history.append(rental)
        return rental

class Inventory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vehicles = []

    def add_vehicle(self, vehicle):
        self.vehicles.append(vehicle)

    def remove_vehicle(self, vehicle):
        self.vehicles.remove(vehicle)

    def get_available_vehicles(self, type=None):
        available_vehicles = [v for v in self.vehicles if v.is_available]
        if type:
            available_vehicles = [v for v in available_vehicles if v.type == type]
        return available_vehicles

class NotificationService:
    def send_notification(self, member, message):
        pass
```

This is a very simplified design and actual implementation can vary significantly. For example, in a real system you would need to handle concurrency to ensure that two members can't rent the same vehicle at the same time. Also, you would need to implement error handling, validation, persistence to a database, a user interface, authentication, and much more. It's also worth noting that you would likely want to use a service-oriented architecture, where different functionalities are encapsulated in separate services.

Sure, I will expand upon the classes and add some more according to the requirements:

1. **Vehicle**: A vehicle should have properties such as VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), make, model, year, mileage, availability status, vehicle type (SUV, Truck, Car, Van, Motorcycle), current parking stall number, a list of past reservations, and a maintenance log.

2. **Reservation**: This class can track details such as the renter (Customer), rented vehicle, start time, end time, insurance information, additional equipment rented, additional services, total price, and reservation status.

3. **Customer**: This represents a user of the system. A customer can have properties such as name, email, phone, address, billing information, and a list of their past reservations.

4. **Employee**: Employees of the rental agency, potentially with different roles (customer service, vehicle maintenance, etc.)

5. **Inventory**: This represents the inventory of vehicles at the rental company. It can allow for the addition/removal of vehicles and facilitate the search and retrieval of vehicles.

6. **NotificationService**: This class handles the sending of notifications.

7. **BillingService**: This class handles payments, including processing deposits and withdrawals.

8. **ReservationService**: Handles the creation, cancellation, and modification of reservations.

```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, vin, make, model, year, mileage, type, parking_stall):
        self.vin = vin
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.mileage = mileage
        self.type = type
        self.parking_stall = parking_stall
        self.is_available = True
        self.reservation_history = []
        self.maintenance_log = []

    def reserve(self, customer, start_date, end_date):
        self.is_available = False
        reservation = Reservation(customer, self, start_date, end_date)
        self.reservation_history.append(reservation)
        return reservation

    def return_vehicle(self):
        self.is_available = True

        self.status = 'Reserved'

    def add_equipment(self, equipment):
        self.equipment.append(equipment)

    def add_service(self, service):
        self.services.append(service)

    def add_insurance(self, insurance):
        self.insurance = insurance

    def cancel(self):
        self.status = 'Cancelled'
        self.vehicle.return_vehicle()


class Customer:
    def __init__(self, name, email, address, billing_info):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.address = address
        self.billing_info = billing_info
        self.reservation_history = []

    def make_reservation(self, vehicle, start_date, end_date):
        reservation = vehicle.reserve(self, start_date, end_date)
        self.reservation_history.append(reservation)
        return reservation

    def cancel_reservation(self, reservation):
        reservation.cancel()


class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, position):
        self.name = name
        self.position = position

    def add_vehicle(self, vehicle):
        self.vehicles.append(vehicle)

    def remove_vehicle(self, vehicle):
        self.vehicles.remove(vehicle)

    def get_available_vehicles(self, type=None):
        available_vehicles = [v for v in self.vehicles if v

.is_available]
        if type:
            available_vehicles = [v for v in available_vehicles if v.type == type]
        return available_vehicles


class NotificationService:
    def send_notification(self, customer, message):
        print(f'Sending notification to {customer.email}: {message}')


class BillingService:
    def process_payment(self, customer, amount):
        print(f'Processing payment of {amount} from {customer.name}')
        # logic to process payment

    def process_refund(self, customer, amount):
        print(f'Processing refund of {amount} to {customer.name}')
        # logic to process refund


class ReservationService:
    def create_reservation(self, customer, vehicle, start_date, end_date):
        return customer.make_reservation(vehicle, start_date, end_date)

    def cancel_reservation(self, reservation):
        reservation.cancel()
```
