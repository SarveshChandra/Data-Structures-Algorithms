Scalability and performance are essential aspects of low-level design and dictate how well an application can handle increasing workloads and utilize resources effectively. 

**1. Scalability**

Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle increasing amounts of work by adding resources to the system. There are two types of scalability:

- **Horizontal scalability (scale-out)**: It involves adding more nodes (servers) to the system. This is easier and more cost-effective in modern cloud-based environments where new instances can be spun up in minutes.

- **Vertical scalability (scale-up)**: It involves increasing the resources (CPU, RAM) of an existing node. This has a limit on how far you can scale based on the capacity of a single machine.

Designing for scalability often involves considering load balancing, data distribution (sharding), and microservices.

**2. Performance**

Performance refers to the speed at which a system can execute a particular task. It's usually measured in terms of latency or throughput.

- **Latency**: The time taken to respond to a request.

- **Throughput**: The number of requests that can be handled in a given amount of time.

Techniques for improving performance include caching, efficient database querying, code optimization, using efficient data structures and algorithms, etc.

**Python Scalability and Performance**

For Python applications, the following strategies could be considered for improving scalability and performance:

- **Concurrency and Parallelism**: For I/O bound tasks, concurrency can be achieved by using threads (through `threading` or higher-level libraries like `concurrent.futures`). For CPU-bound tasks, parallelism can be achieved by using processes (through `multiprocessing` or `concurrent.futures`).

- **Async IO**: Python's `asyncio` library can be used for writing single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other resources, and implementing network protocols.

- **Caching**: If your application repeatedly executes expensive operations, it could be beneficial to store the results of those operations in a cache and reuse them. Python offers several caching libraries and techniques, including `functools.lru_cache` and `memcached`.

- **Profiling**: Profiling is the process of measuring the resources (CPU, memory, etc.) that your program uses. Python offers several tools for this, including the `cProfile` module and third-party tools like `py-spy`.

- **Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) servers**: In Python web development, using WSGI servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI can help to handle more traffic and provide better performance compared to built-in development servers.

- **Database optimizations**: Techniques such as using database indexes, denormalization where appropriate, using faster serialization formats, etc., can improve performance.

- **Distributed Task Queues**: For offloading long-running tasks and achieving distributed processing, tools like Celery can be used.

In terms of low-level design, the key is to identify potential bottlenecks, use the right data structures, libraries, and design patterns that allow the system to efficiently manage and process tasks, and design the system in a way that it can scale as needed.

Let's provide an example in the context of a web service that involves some expensive computations, such as a machine learning model prediction. 

For the sake of simplicity, we'll use Flask for the web framework, joblib for caching expensive computations, and Celery for offloading tasks and distributing processing.

First, let's set up our Celery application:

```python
from celery import Celery

# Assume we're using RabbitMQ as our message broker.
app = Celery('tasks', broker='pyamqp://guest@localhost//')

@app.task
def expensive_computation(x):
    # Simulate an expensive computation by sleeping.
    from time import sleep
    sleep(5)  # This could be a machine learning prediction, for instance.
    return x * x
```

Next, let's set up our Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from tasks import expensive_computation

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json()
    x = data['x']
    result = expensive_computation.delay(x)
    return jsonify({"task_id": str(result.task_id)}), 202

@app.route('/result/<task_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_result(task_id):
    result = expensive_computation.AsyncResult(task_id)
    if result.ready():
        return jsonify({"result": result.get()}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({"status": "pending"}), 202

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this application, the client sends a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with the input data. Instead of running the expensive computation in the request-response cycle, the computation is offloaded to Celery. This allows the application to quickly respond to the client with a task ID that can be used to retrieve the result when it's ready.

When the client wants to retrieve the result, they send a GET request to the `/result/<task_id>` endpoint. If the computation is finished, the result is returned. Otherwise, the client is informed that the result is still pending.

To improve performance, you could add caching to the expensive computation. If you're using a function to compute the results, you could use joblib's `Memory` class to cache the results:

```python
from joblib import Memory

memory = Memory("cache_directory", verbose=0)

@memory.cache
def compute_expensive_operation(x):
    # Your expensive computation here.
    pass
```

For database optimizations, if you're using SQLAlchemy with Flask, you could use its functionalities for eager loading to reduce database queries, create indexes for frequently queried columns, etc.

For better performance and scalability, you should also consider deploying the Flask application using a WSGI server, such as Gunicorn or uWSGI, in a production environment. 

Please note, these examples illustrate the concepts, but they are simplistic. In a real-world application, you'll have to handle more cases, and you'll have to use additional technologies and techniques based on your specific requirements.
