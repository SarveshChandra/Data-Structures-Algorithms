Function 1: Two Sum
The two sum problem asks us to find two numbers in an array that add up to a target value. Here's an implementation using a dictionary:

python
Copy code
def two_sum(nums, target):
    """
    Given an array of integers `nums` and a target value `target`,
    returns a list of the indices of two numbers that add up to `target`.

        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
This function has a time complexity of O(n) because we only loop through the array once, and a space complexity of O(n) because we store each number and its index in a dictionary.

Function 2: Group Anagrams
The group anagrams problem asks us to group a list of words into sets of anagrams. Here's an implementation using a dictionary:

python
Copy code
def group_anagrams(words):
    """
    Given a list of words `words`, returns a list of lists where each sublist
    contains all the anagrams of a given word in `words`.

        else:
            anagrams[sorted_word] = [word]
    return list(anagrams.values())
This function has a time complexity of O(n * k * log(k)), where n is the number of words and k is the maximum length of a word. We sort each word to find its anagrams, which takes O(k * log(k)) time, and we do this for each word in the list. The space complexity is also O(n * k) because we store each word and its sorted version in a dictionary.

Function 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
The longest substring without repeating characters problem asks us to find the length of the longest substring in a string without any repeating characters. Here's an implementation using a dictionary:

python
Copy code
def longest_substring_without_repeating(s):
    """
    Given a string `s`, returns the length of the longest substring without
    any repeating characters.
    """
    seen = {}
    start = 0
    longest = 0
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in seen and seen[char] >= start:
            start = seen[char] + 1
        seen[char] = i
        longest = max(longest, i - start + 1)
    return longest
This function has a time complexity of O(n) because we loop through the string once, and a space complexity of O(min(n, k)) where k is the size of the character set (i.e. 256 for ASCII characters). We store each character and its index in a dictionary, but since the character set is limited, the space complexity is not dependent on the length of the input string.

        seen[sum_so_far] = seen.get(sum_so_far, 0) + 1
    return count
This function has a time complexity of O(n) because we loop through the array once, and a space complexity of O(n) because we store the sum_so_far values and their frequencies in a dictionary.

Function 6: Grouping Transactions by User

python
Copy code
def group_transactions_by_user(transactions):
    """
    Given a list of transactions `transactions`, returns a dictionary where
    each key is a user id and each value is a list of the user's transactions.
    """
    grouped = {}
    for transaction in transactions:
        user_id = transaction['user_id']
        if user_id in grouped:
            grouped[user_id].append(transaction)
        else:
            grouped[user_id] = [transaction]
    return grouped
This function has a time complexity of O(n) because we loop through the list of transactions once, and a space complexity of O(n) because we store the user ids and their associated transactions in a dictionary.

Function 8: Majority Element
The majority element problem asks us to find the element in an array that appears more than n/2 times, where n is the length of the array. Here's an implementation using a dictionary:

    """
    Given an array of integers `nums`, returns the majority element that appears
    more than n/2 times, where n is the length of the array.

Function 14: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Function 16: Group Anagrams
The group anagrams problem asks us to group a list of strings strs into anagrams, i.e., strings that contain the same characters but in a different order. Here's an implementation using a dictionary:

        if key not in groups:
            groups[key] = []
        groups[key].append(s)

This function has a time complexity of O(nmlog(m)) because we loop through the list of strings strs once, and for each string, we sort its characters (which takes O(mlog(m)) time) and use the sorted string as a key in the dictionary. The space complexity is O(nm) because in the worst case, all the strings in strs are distinct anagrams, so we store them all in the dictionary.

Function 17: First Unique Character in a String
The first unique character in a string problem asks us to find the index of the first non-repeating character in a string s. Here's an implementation using a dictionary:

python

    for i in range(len(s)):
        if freq[s[i]] == 1:
            return i
    return -1
This function has a time complexity of O(n) because we loop through the string s twice, and a space complexity of O(m) because we store the frequency of each character in s in a dictionary.

These are just a few examples of how dictionaries can be used to solve DSA problems in Python. Depending on the problem, there may be more efficient or elegant solutions using other data structures, but dictionaries are often a good starting point.

This function has a time complexity of O(1), since we know the board size is always 9x9, and a space complexity of O(1) as well, since we only create three dictionaries of size 9 each.

Function 19: Word Pattern
The word pattern problem asks us to determine whether a given pattern pattern matches a given string s, where a match means that each character in pattern corresponds to a unique word in s, and vice versa. Here's an implementation using dictionaries:

This function has a time complexity of O(n), since we need to loop through the pattern and words once, and a space complexity of O(m), where m is the number of unique words in s.

Function 20: Group Shifted Strings
The group shifted strings problem asks us to group a list of strings strings that are shifted versions of each other, i.e., they differ only by a constant amount in the ASCII values of their characters. Here's an implementation using dictionaries:

        else:
            groups[key] = [s]

    return list(groups.values())
This function has a time complexity of O(nm), where n is the number of strings in strings and m is the length of the longest string, since we need to loop through each string and compute the differences between its characters. Its space complexity is also O(nm), since we need to store the differences for each string.

Function 21: Intersection of Two Arrays
The intersection of two arrays problem asks us to find the intersection of two given arrays nums1 and nums2, where the intersection is defined as the set of elements that are present in both arrays. Here's an implementation using dictionaries:

python
Copy code
def intersection(nums1, nums2):
    """
    Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, returns their intersection.
    """
    counts = {}
    for num in nums1:
        counts[num] = counts.get(num, 0) + 1

    intersection = []
    for num in nums2:
        if num in counts and counts[num] > 0:
            intersection.append(num)
            counts[num] -= 1

    return intersection
This function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the longer array, since we need to loop through each element of the arrays at most once. Its space complexity is also O(n), since we need to store the counts of each element in nums1.

Function 22: Count Primes
The count primes problem asks us to count the number of prime numbers less than a given number n. Here's an implementation using dictionaries:

python
Copy code
def count_primes(n):
    """
    Given a number `n`, counts the number of prime numbers less than `n`.
    """
    primes = {}
    count = 0

    for i in range(2, n):
        if i not in primes:
            count += 1
            for j in range(i*i, n, i):
                primes[j] = 1

    return count
This function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to count the number of prime numbers less than n. It has a time complexity of O(n log log n) and a space complexity of O(n), since we need to store a dictionary of size n to mark the non-prime numbers.
