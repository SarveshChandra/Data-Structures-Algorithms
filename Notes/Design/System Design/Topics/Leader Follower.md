# Leader Follower

In distributed system design, the leader-follower (also known as master-slave or primary-replica) pattern is a common strategy for managing replicas of data. The pattern is useful for achieving data redundancy and improving read performance in a system.

**Leader-Follower Pattern**

In the leader-follower model, one node is designated as the "leader" (also referred to as "master" or "primary"), and the remaining nodes are "followers" (also known as "slaves" or "replicas"). 

The leader handles all write operations and applies them to its local data store. The followers then replicate these changes by processing updates from the leader. Read operations can be handled by either the leader or the followers, depending on the consistency requirements of the system. 

Here are the key components of the leader-follower pattern:

**1. Leader**: The leader is responsible for handling all write requests. When a write request comes in, the leader writes the data to its local storage and also sends the update to all its followers. 

**2. Follower**: Each follower receives updates from the leader and applies them to its local storage. Followers can also handle read requests, which can significantly increase the read capacity of the system.

**3. Replication**: The process of keeping the leader and follower data synchronized is called replication. This can be done synchronously or asynchronously. In synchronous replication, the leader waits for all followers to confirm that they have written the data before the write operation is considered successful. In asynchronous replication, the leader sends updates to the followers and moves on to the next write operation without waiting for confirmations.

**Example**: A real-world example of a system that uses the leader-follower pattern is a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL configured with one primary and multiple replicas. The primary database handles all write operations, while the replicas maintain a copy of the data which can be read from. 

This setup can greatly increase the capacity of the system to handle read requests, as they can be distributed among multiple replicas. However, write capacity is limited by the performance of the primary database, as all write requests must be handled by it.

**Advantages and Disadvantages of Leader-Follower**

**Advantages:**

1. **Read Scalability**: Read requests can be distributed among multiple followers, increasing the system's capacity to handle large volumes of read traffic.

2. **Data Redundancy**: By maintaining multiple copies of the data, the system can withstand the failure of nodes without losing data.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Write Scalability**: Since all write operations must be handled by the leader, the system's capacity to handle write traffic is limited by the performance of the leader.

2. **Consistency**: If replication is done asynchronously, it's possible for the followers to be momentarily inconsistent with the leader, which might be an issue for some applications.
   
3. **Complexity**: Implementing and managing a leader-follower setup adds complexity to the system, especially when handling node failures and ensuring data consistency.

Overall, the leader-follower pattern is a powerful tool in the design of distributed systems, and understanding it is key to making effective design decisions.

To extend the topic further, let's discuss how failover, data consistency, and load balancing are handled in a leader-follower system.

**Failover in Leader-Follower Systems**

The leader-follower model needs to be prepared for the case when the leader fails. This process is known as failover. In the event of a leader failure, one of the followers must be promoted to become the new leader. 

This promotion process might be manual, requiring a system administrator to intervene, or it can be automatic. Automatic failover can be complex to implement properly, because it requires some form of consensus among the followers to ensure that only one follower is promoted to the new leader.

An important point is the handling of any unreplicated writes that the leader might have processed but not yet propagated to the followers before it failed. Depending on the nature of the system and its data, it might be acceptable to lose these updates, or it might be necessary to recover them.

**Data Consistency**

Data consistency can be a challenging issue in a leader-follower model. As mentioned before, followers can lag behind the leader if the replication is done asynchronously, which can lead to stale reads.

If strong consistency is required (i.e., any read operation always returns the most recent write), you may need to configure your system to use synchronous replication. However, synchronous replication can impact performance because it requires the leader to wait for acknowledgment from all followers before a write is considered successful.

**Load Balancing**

While read operations can be load-balanced across all nodes (including the leader), write operations are only handled by the leader. If your system is write-heavy, this could put a significant load on the leader. Also, if read operations are so numerous that the leader cannot keep up with replicating writes to followers, the system can become overloaded.

In these cases, you may need to consider techniques like sharding, where the data is partitioned, and different partitions are written to by different leaders. This can spread the write load across multiple nodes.

## Example: Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka, a popular distributed streaming platform, uses the leader-follower model for replicating its data. Each partition of a Kafka topic has one leader and multiple followers. All writes and reads to a partition go through the leader, and the followers passively replicate the data. If a leader fails, one of the followers is automatically promoted to be the new leader. This provides both data redundancy and load balancing of read and write operations.

Understanding the leader-follower model in distributed systems can help in making design decisions that balance data consistency, system performance, and the ability to handle node failures. However, it's important to note that the leader-follower model is just one strategy for managing data in a distributed system, and the best approach depends on the specific use case and requirements.



As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to directly create diagrams. However, I can describe to you what a typical leader-follower diagram might look like:

1. Draw a series of circles horizontally across the page, each one representing a node in the system.

2. Label the first circle "Leader", and the remaining circles as "Follower 1", "Follower 2", and so forth.

3. Draw an arrow from the Leader to each follower to represent the flow of data from the leader to the followers.

4. In case of leader failure, you might draw an 'X' over the Leader node and a double-sided arrow between Follower 1 and the rest of the followers to represent a failover scenario where Follower 1 has become the new leader.

5. Write operations are depicted as arrows coming from outside the system to the Leader node. Read operations can be depicted as arrows coming from the nodes (both Leader and Followers) to outside the system.

This should give you a visual representation of a leader-follower system.

## QnAs

Sure, here are some potential interview questions and answers about the leader-follower pattern in system design:

**1. Q: Can you explain the leader-follower pattern in distributed systems?**

A: The leader-follower pattern, also known as the master-slave pattern, is a model where one node, the leader, handles all write operations and the other nodes, the followers, replicate the leader's state. The leader writes the data to its store and sends the updates to all its followers. This pattern is often used to achieve redundancy and improve read performance in a system.

**2. Q: How is data consistency maintained in a leader-follower model?**

A: Data consistency in a leader-follower model can be maintained through either synchronous or asynchronous replication. In synchronous replication, the leader waits for acknowledgments from all followers before a write is considered successful. In asynchronous replication, the leader sends updates to the followers and moves on to the next write operation without waiting for acknowledgments, which might lead to temporary inconsistencies.

**3. Q: How is failover handled in the leader-follower pattern?**

A: In the event of a leader failure, one of the followers is promoted to become the new leader, a process known as failover. This process can be manual, requiring intervention from a system administrator, or it can be automatic, which can be more complex to implement as it requires consensus among the followers.

**4. Q: What are some advantages and disadvantages of the leader-follower pattern?**

A: Advantages of the leader-follower pattern include increased read scalability, as read requests can be distributed among followers, and data redundancy. Some disadvantages are the limitation in write scalability, potential inconsistencies in an asynchronous replication setup, and the added complexity of implementing and managing the leader-follower model.

**5. Q: Can you give a real-world example of a system that uses the leader-follower pattern?**

A: A common real-world example is a relational database configured with one primary (leader) and multiple replicas (followers). The primary handles all write operations, and the replicas maintain copies of the data, which can be read from. This increases the system's capacity to handle read requests by distributing them among multiple replicas.
  
**6. Q: How does the leader-follower model handle write-heavy workloads?**

A: In a write-heavy system, since all write operations must go through the leader, the write performance is tied to the performance of the leader. Techniques like sharding, where different data partitions are written to by different leaders, may be used to distribute the write load across multiple nodes and mitigate the load on a single leader.
