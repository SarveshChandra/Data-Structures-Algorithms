# Online Stock Brokerage System

**Requirements**

1. Any user of our system should be able to buy and sell stocks.
2. Any user can have multiple watchlists containing multiple stock
quotes.
3. Users should be able to place stock trade orders of the following
types: 1) market, 2) limit, 3) stop loss and, 4) stop limit.
4. Users can have multiple ‘lots’ of a stock. This means that if a user has
bought a stock multiple times, the system should be able to
differentiate between different lots of the same stock.
5. The system should be able to generate reports for quarterly updates
and yearly tax statements.
6. Users should be able to deposit and withdraw money either via
check, wire, or electronic bank transfer.
7. The system should be able to send notifications whenever trade
orders are executed.

Here's an outline of the classes that a production-grade online stock brokerage system could have:

1. **User**
    - Attributes: UserId, Name, Email, Password, Address, PhoneNumber, BankAccount(s), Portfolio, WatchList(s)
    - Methods: AddWatchList(), RemoveWatchList(), BuyStock(), SellStock(), DepositMoney(), WithdrawMoney(), GenerateReport()

2. **BankAccount**
    - Attributes: AccountId, Balance
    - Methods: Deposit(), Withdraw()

3. **WatchList**
    - Attributes: WatchListId, UserId, StockQuote(s)
    - Methods: AddStockQuote(), RemoveStockQuote()

4. **StockQuote**
    - Attributes: TickerSymbol, CurrentPrice
    - Methods: UpdatePrice()

5. **Portfolio**
    - Attributes: PortfolioId, UserId, Lot(s)
    - Methods: AddLot(), RemoveLot(), GetLot()

6. **Lot**
    - Attributes: LotId, TickerSymbol, PurchaseDate, PurchasePrice, Quantity
    - Methods: Buy(), Sell()

7. **TradeOrder**
    - Attributes: OrderId, UserId, TickerSymbol, OrderType (Market, Limit, Stop Loss, Stop Limit), Quantity
    - Methods: PlaceOrder(), CancelOrder()

8. **NotificationService**
    - Methods: SendNotification()

This is a high-level overview of the classes in the system. Depending on the specific requirements and use cases, there may be more classes and each class might have more detailed attributes and methods. For example, for the NotificationService, there might be different methods for different types of notifications, or the methods might take different parameters depending on the information that needs to be included in the notification. 

Also, while designing a system, we should also consider edge cases and handle errors effectively to ensure the reliability of the system. For example, what if a user tries to buy more stocks than they can afford? What if they try to sell stocks they don't own? The system should be designed to handle these cases gracefully. Also, issues like data concurrency should be handled when users are buying/selling stocks simultaneously. 

Finally, ensure the system is scalable to handle a large number of users and data, and is secure to protect sensitive information. 

This design serves as a starting point and can be expanded and refined according to specific requirements or constraints.

Sure, let's further expand on each of the components in the system:

1. **User**: This class represents a user in the system.

    ```python
    class User:
        def __init__(self, id, name, email, password, address, phone_number):
            self.id = id
            self.name = name
            self.email = email
            self.password = password
            self.address = address
            self.phone_number = phone_number
            self.bank_accounts = []
            self.watchlists = []
            self.portfolio = Portfolio(self.id)

        def add_bank_account(self, bank_account):
            self.bank_accounts.append(bank_account)
        
        def create_watchlist(self, watchlist_name):
            watchlist = WatchList(watchlist_name, self.id)
            self.watchlists.append(watchlist)

        def remove_watchlist(self, watchlist_name):
            self.watchlists = [watchlist for watchlist in self.watchlists if watchlist.name != watchlist_name]
        
        def place_order(self, order_type, stock_symbol, quantity, price=None):
            order = TradeOrder(self.id, order_type, stock_symbol, quantity, price)
            order.execute()
            return order
    ```

2. **BankAccount**: This class represents a bank account.

    ```python
    class BankAccount:
        def __init__(self, id, balance):
            self.id = id
            self.balance = balance

        def deposit(self, amount):
            self.balance += amount

        def withdraw(self, amount):
            if amount > self.balance:
                raise InsufficientBalanceError()
            self.balance -= amount
    ```

3. **WatchList**: This class represents a user's watchlist.

    ```python
    class WatchList:
        def __init__(self, name, user_id):
            self.name = name
            self.user_id = user_id
            self.stock_quotes = []

        def add_stock_quote(self, stock_quote):
            self.stock_quotes.append(stock_quote)

        def remove_stock_quote(self, ticker_symbol):
            self.stock_quotes = [quote for quote in self.stock_quotes if quote.ticker_symbol != ticker_symbol]
    ```

4. **StockQuote**: This class represents a stock quote in a watchlist.

    ```python
    class StockQuote:
        def __init__(self, ticker_symbol, current_price):
            self.ticker_symbol = ticker_symbol
            self.current_price = current_price
    ```

5. **Portfolio**: This class represents a user's portfolio.

    ```python
    class Portfolio:
        def __init__(self, user_id):
            self.user_id = user_id
            self.lots = []

        def add_lot(self, lot):
            self.lots.append(lot)

        def remove_lot(self, lot_id):
            self.lots = [lot for lot in self.lots if lot.id != lot_id]

        def get_lot(self, lot_id):
            for lot in self.lots:
                if lot.id == lot_id:
                    return lot
            return None
    ```

6. **Lot**: This class represents a lot of a stock in a portfolio.

    ```python
    class Lot:
        def __init__(self, id, ticker_symbol, purchase_date, purchase_price, quantity):
            self.id = id
            self.ticker_symbol = ticker_symbol
            self.purchase_date = purchase_date
            self.purchase_price = purchase_price
            self.quantity = quantity
    ```

7. **TradeOrder**: This class represents a trade order.

    ```python
    class TradeOrder:
        def __init__(self, user_id, order_type, ticker_symbol, quantity, price=None):
            self.user_id =

 user_id
            self.order_type = order_type
            self.ticker_symbol = ticker_symbol
            self.quantity = quantity
            self.price = price

        def execute(self):
            # Here is where we would interact with a stock exchange to place the actual order. This would involve a lot of additional error handling and might also be done asynchronously or in a separate service, depending on the architecture of the system.
            pass
    ```

8. **NotificationService**: This class handles sending notifications.

    ```python
    class NotificationService:
        def send_notification(self, user_id, message):
            # Here is where we would actually send the notification, probably by email or SMS. This would involve interfacing with some sort of external service, and so would also involve error handling and possibly asynchronous processing.
            pass
    ```

Please note that this is still a high-level overview of the system, and actual implementation may vary significantly based on specific requirements, constraints, and architecture decisions. The key is to keep responsibilities separated between different parts of the system, and to think about how those parts will interact with each other and with any external systems or services. 

This design still has lots of room for improvements. For example, we could add more methods and data members to classes, use interfaces and abstract classes to make it more flexible, and use design patterns to make it more understandable and maintainable. But I hope this gives a good starting point to your system design.
