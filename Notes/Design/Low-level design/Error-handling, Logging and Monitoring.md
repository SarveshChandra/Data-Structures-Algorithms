Sure, error-handling, logging, and monitoring are essential parts of software development and low-level design. Let's discuss each of these aspects.

**1. Error Handling:** Error handling is the process of responding to exceptions â€“ conditions that disrupt the normal flow of a program. The primary goal of error handling is to prevent your program from crashing when an exception occurs.

Python uses a system of built-in exceptions and exception handling keywords for this purpose. You can `raise` an exception in your code, `try` to run code that might raise an exception, `except` a raised exception, and `finally` run cleanup code whether an exception was raised or not.

For example:

```python
try:
    x = 1 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    x = 0  # Handle the error by setting x to 0
finally:
    print("Cleanup code goes here.")
```

**2. Logging:** Logging is the practice of recording information about your program's execution for debugging and auditing purposes. It's usually done with the help of a logging library.

Python's built-in `logging` module is widely used for this purpose:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logging.debug("This is a debug message")  # Will not be printed
logging.info("This is an info message")  # Will be printed
```

Logs can be written to files for persistent storage, and can include a variety of information such as timestamps, error messages, information about the current execution context, etc.

**3. Monitoring:** Monitoring is the practice of collecting, processing, aggregating, and displaying real-time information about a system. 

In a Python application, you might use a library like `psutil` to collect system statistics, a service like StatsD or Prometheus to aggregate your statistics, and a service like Graphite or Grafana to display your statistics.

Monitoring can provide insights about the runtime behavior of your application and can help you identify performance bottlenecks, resource usage patterns, and potential points of failure.

In terms of low-level design, you'll want to consider:

- What conditions should be considered errors in each part of your system.
- What information to include in log messages and when to log them.
- What aspects of your system to monitor, how to collect that data, and how to interpret it.

Remember, proper error handling, logging, and monitoring can greatly improve the maintainability and reliability of a system. Therefore, they should be integral parts of your design and implementation process.
