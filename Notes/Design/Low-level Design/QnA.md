Here are some low-level design (also known as detailed or software design) interview questions and brief answers:

1. **What is low-level design?**
   Low-level design is a component-level design process that follows a step-by-step process from requirements gathered during high-level design to the final system. It usually includes the design of data structures, software architecture, interfaces, and algorithms.

2. **Can you explain the Singleton design pattern?**
   The Singleton pattern restricts a class from instantiating multiple objects. It is used where only a single instance of a class is required to control actions. This is usually used in logging, driver objects, caching, database connections, etc.

3. **What's the difference between a stack and a queue?**
   Both stack and queue are abstract data types that store items in a collection. The primary distinction lies in the removal. A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, i.e., the element inserted at the end is the first one to be removed. In contrast, a queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, the element inserted at the beginning is the first one to be removed.

4. **What are the different types of linked lists?**
   There are three types of Linked Lists: singly linked lists (each node points to the next node), doubly linked lists (each node points to both next and previous node), and circular linked lists (the last node in the list points back to the first).

5. **Can you explain the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture?**
   In MVC architecture, the 'Model' represents the application data and business logic, the 'View' defines how to display the data, and the 'Controller' manages the data flow into the model object and updates the view whenever data changes.

6. **How can you handle data concurrency in your software design?**
   Data concurrency can be handled in many ways including Optimistic concurrency control (versioning), Pessimistic concurrency control (locking), using database transactions, or leveraging concurrency control provided by databases or programming languages.

7. **What is the Factory Method design pattern?**
   The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

8. **Can you explain the concept of database normalization?**
   Database normalization is the process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of normal forms to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between the tables.
   
9. **What is Database indexing, and why is it used?**
   Database Indexing is used to retrieve data more quickly than would otherwise be possible. Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a database table every time a database table is accessed.

10. **Can you explain the concept of sharding in databases?**
   Sharding is a method of splitting and storing a single logical dataset in multiple databases. By distributing the data among multiple machines, a cluster of database systems can store larger dataset and handle additional requests.

Remember, the best way to answer these questions in an interview is to provide concrete examples from your own work experience to show how you have used these concepts in real-world projects.

Sure, here are a few more low-level design questions and brief answers:

1. **What is the Decorator design pattern?**
   The decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It involves a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete objects. Decorator classes mirror the type of the objects they decorate.

2. **What is Inversion of Control (IoC)?**
   Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering by which the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework. It's most often used in the context of object-oriented programming. By decoupling the execution of a task from its implementation, it helps in the separation of concerns.

3. **What is the difference between Composition and Aggregation?**
   Composition and Aggregation are two types of Association in OOP. In composition, if the parent object is destroyed, then the child objects also cease to exist. In aggregation, child objects do not depend on the parent object's lifecycle.

4. **What is a HashTable?**
   A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

5. **What is the Observer design pattern?**
   The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

6. **What are the ACID properties in a database transaction?**
   ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. These set properties of database transactions intend to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, etc.

7. **What is polymorphism in OOP?**
   Polymorphism is a concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It supports the use of a single interface to represent different types.

8. **What is the difference between overriding and overloading a method in OOP?**
   Overloading allows multiple methods to have the same name, but different signatures in the class. Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a different implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.

9. **What is a deadlock?**
   A deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process. They often occur in concurrent processing where the ordering of operations is significant.

10. **Can you explain what a relational database is?**
   A relational database is a type of database that uses a structured query language (SQL) for manipulating and querying data. The data in a relational database is organized into tables, and a unique key identifies each data record or row.

Remember, always try to support your answers with examples from your personal work experience or any relevant projects you've done. This shows that you've had practical experience with these concepts.

Absolutely, here are more low-level design interview questions with brief responses:

1. **What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?**
   An abstract class can have implemented methods and can define fields, while an interface only declares methods and they must be abstract. An abstract class can have static methods while an interface cannot. In many languages, a class can inherit from one superclass but can implement multiple interfaces.

2. **Explain the Singleton design pattern.**
   The Singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance. This pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

3. **What is the Factory design pattern?**
   The Factory pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This is done by creating objects via a factory method, which is either specified in an interface and implemented in implementing classes; or it is implemented in a base class (optionally as a default method) and can be optionally overridden by derived classes.

4. **How can you prevent SQL Injection in your application?**
   SQL Injection can be prevented by using parameterized queries or prepared statements, escaping all user-supplied input, or using an ORM framework that safely constructs SQL for you.

5. **What is a race condition? How can you avoid it?**
   A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. As a result, the value of variables may be unpredictable and vary depending on the timings of context switches of the processes. Race conditions can be avoided by proper thread synchronization techniques, such as using locks or semaphores.

6. **What are transactions? Why are they important?**
   A transaction is a single logical unit of work that accesses and possibly modifies the contents of a database. Transactions are important because they ensure data integrity and consistency. They follow ACID properties - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

7. **What is the Command design pattern?**
   The command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This information includes the method name, the object that owns the method, and values for the method parameters.

8. **What is the Proxy design pattern?**
   The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. The pattern involves a class, called the proxy, which has the same interface as the real object. The proxy holds a reference to the real object and can be used to control access or reduce the cost of creating the real object.

9. **How would you design a cache?**
   A cache can be designed using a data structure like a hash table for O(1) access and a double linked list for maintaining the entries based on their usage. The recently used entries can be at one end and the least recently used entries at the other end. This would be a simple implementation of an LRU cache. 

10. **What is the Visitor design pattern?**
   The Visitor pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. This allows new operations to be added to existing object structures without modifying those structures. It is a way of decoupling an algorithm from an object structure upon which it operates.

Remember to always give examples or scenarios when explaining these concepts, as it gives a clearer picture of your understanding and application of them.

Sure, here are more low-level design interview questions and answers:

1. **What is a Distributed System?**
    A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to each other. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal. 

2. **What is Multi-Threading?**
    Multithreading is a type of execution model that allows multiple threads to exist within the context of a single process, sharing the process's resources but able to execute independently. The threaded programming model provides developers with a useful abstraction of concurrent execution. 

3. **What are Microservices?**
    Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are highly maintainable and testable, loosely coupled, independently deployable, organized around business capabilities, and can be owned by a small team. 

4. **What is Inversion of Control (IoC)?**
    Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering by which the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework. It's most often used in the context of object-oriented programming. By decoupling the execution of a task from implementation, it provides a modular architecture, enhancing reusability.

5. **What is the Decorator design pattern?**
    The Decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

6. **What is the difference between Stack and Queue?**
    Stack and Queue are both data structures. The stack follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. That is, the last element that is added to the stack is the first one to be removed. A queue, on the other hand, follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. This means the first element that is added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

7. **Explain how Hashmap works in Java.**
    HashMap in Java works on the principle of hashing. It uses an array and LinkedList data structure internally for storing Key and Value. Each key-value pair is stored in a bucket (LinkedList). When we pass Key and Value to `put()` method, it uses the hashcode of the key to determine the bucket index where the value should be stored.

8. **What is the use of ConcurrentHashMap in Java?**
    ConcurrentHashMap is a class in Java that implements the ConcurrentMap interface. It is used in multithreading environments and is thread-safe. It allows concurrent access and operations on the Map, improving performance in a multi-threaded environment.

9. **What is the principle of SOLID?**
    SOLID stands for Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, and Dependency inversion. These are five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

10. **What is Event-Driven Programming?**
    Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs. This is common in graphical user interfaces and real-time systems. 

Remember that when you answer these questions, it's important to explain them using examples or practical use-cases to demonstrate a clear understanding of these concepts.
Sure, here are some more low-level design interview questions and answers:

1. **What is a Linked List?**
   A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers. In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

2. **What is a Singleton pattern? Can you provide an example?**
   Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance while providing a global access point to this instance. For example, in Python:

   ```python
   class Singleton:
       __instance = None
       
       @staticmethod
       def getInstance():
           if Singleton.__instance == None:
               Singleton()
           return Singleton.__instance
       
       def __init__(self):
           if Singleton.__instance != None:
               raise Exception("This class is a singleton!")
           else:
               Singleton.__instance = self
   ```

3. **What is the Factory Method pattern?**
   The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

4. **Can you explain the difference between Composition and Inheritance?**
   Inheritance is a mechanism where you can derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods. Composition allows a class to contain an instance of another class.

5. **What is a race condition?**
   A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. As a result, the values of variables may be unpredictable and vary depending on the timings of context switches of the processes.

6. **What are deadlocks?**
   Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process.

7. **What is the difference between an array and a linked list?**
   The main difference between these data structures is that arrays are static (same size) while linked lists are dynamic (grow and shrink at run-time). Elements in an array are stored next to each other in memory whereas in a linked list, elements are linked together with pointers.

8. **What is the Observer design pattern?**
   The Observer Pattern is a software design pattern that establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects. Anytime the state of one of the objects (the "subject" or "observable") changes, all of the other dependent objects ("observers") are notified and automatically updated.

9. **What are the differences between a stack and a queue?**
   The main difference lies in the order of the elements. A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. In contrast, a queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

10. **What is Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming?**
   Polymorphism is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. We can create functions or reference variables which behaves differently in different programmatic context. This provides a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there’s no confusion with mixing types but each child class keeps its own methods as they are.
   
Remember that demonstrating clear understanding of these concepts is best done with real-world examples and use-cases.

Sure, here are a few more low-level design questions along with brief answers:

11. **What is a Binary Search Tree?**
    A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties:
    - The left sub-tree of a node has a key less than its parent node's key.
    - The right sub-tree of a node has a key greater than its parent node's key.
    Thus, BST divides all its sub-trees into two segments; the left sub-tree and the right sub-tree and can be defined as left_subtree (keys) ≤ node (key) ≤ right_subtree (keys).

12. **What is Load Balancing?**
    Load balancing is the practice of distributing network traffic across multiple servers. This ensures no single server bears too much demand. By spreading the work evenly, load balancing improves responsiveness and increases availability of applications.

13. **What is the Decorator Pattern?**
    The Decorator Pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern is useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern.

14. **What is a Hash Table?**
    A Hash Table (also called a Hash Map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. Hash Table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

15. **What is a B-tree?**
    A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. It's commonly used in databases and filesystems.

16. **What is Model-View-Controller (MVC)?**
    MVC is a design pattern used to decouple user-interface (view), data (model), and application logic (controller). This pattern helps to achieve separation of concerns.

17. **Explain the concept of Threading.**
    Threading is a feature of modern operating systems that allows a single process to have multiple flows of control - almost like having multiple 'mini processes' within a main process. Threads within a process share the same data space, which means they can communicate with each other more easily than if they were separate processes.

18. **What is a Heap data structure?**
    A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:
    - Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
    - Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

19. **What is the Bridge Design Pattern?**
    Bridge is a structural design pattern that divides a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation. It provides a way to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

20. **What is the Builder Pattern?**
    Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, so the same construction process can create different representations.

Remember, having a strong grasp of fundamental concepts and being able to apply them to practical use-cases is key to mastering low-level system design.
