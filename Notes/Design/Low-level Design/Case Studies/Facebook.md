# Facebook

**Requirements**

1. Each member should be able to add information about their basic
profile, work experience, education, etc.
2. Any user of our system should be able to search other members,
groups or pages by their name.
3. Members should be able to send and accept/reject friend requests
from other members.
4. Members should be able to follow other members without becoming
their friend.
5. Members should be able to create groups and pages, as well as join
already created groups, and follow pages.
6. Members should be able to create new posts to share with their
friends.
7. Members should be able to add comments to posts, as well as like or
share a post or comment.
8. Members should be able to create privacy lists containing their
friends. Members can link any post with a privacy list to make the
post visible only to the members of that list.
9. Any member should be able to send messages to other members.
10. Any member should be able to add a recommendation for any page.
11. The system should send a notification to a member whenever there is
a new message or friend request or comment on their post.
12. Members should be able to search through posts for a word.
Extended Requirement: Write a function to find a connection suggestion
for a member.

To design a production-grade Facebook-like system, we would need to consider many aspects and features. Below is a high-level design for the classes needed to fulfill these requirements:

1. `User`: This class represents a user of the system. It should contain profile information, friends list, privacy lists, groups, pages, posts, etc.

2. `Post`: This class represents a post made by a user. It contains text, media attachments, privacy settings, likes, shares, and comments.

3. `Group`: This class represents a group of users. It contains information about the group, list of users, and posts in the group.

4. `Page`: This class represents a page, similar to a group but with additional features like recommendations and followers.

5. `Message`: This class represents a message sent by one user to another or to a group.

6. `Notification`: This class represents a notification to a user.

7. `Comment`: This class represents a comment made by a user on a post.

8. `PrivacyList`: This class represents a custom privacy list that can be used by a user to limit the visibility of their posts.

9. `SearchEngine`: This class provides a way to search for users, groups, pages, and posts.

Here's the basic structure for these classes:

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.profile = Profile()
        self.friends = []
        self.privacyLists = []
        self.groups = []
        self.pages = []
        self.posts = []

    def send_friend_request(self, other_user):
        pass

    def accept_friend_request(self, other_user):
        pass

    def follow_user(self, other_user):
        pass

    def create_post(self, post):
        pass

    def add_comment(self, post, comment):
        pass

    def like_post(self, post):
        pass

    def create_group(self, group):
        pass

    def join_group(self, group):
        pass

    def create_page(self, page):
        pass

    def follow_page(self, page):
        pass

class Post:
    def __init__(self, content):
        self.content = content
        self.comments = []
        self.likes = 0
        self.shares = 0

class Group:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.members = []
        self.posts = []

class Page:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.followers = []
        self.posts = []
        self.recommendations = []

class Message:
    def __init__(self, sender, content):
        self.sender = sender
        self.content = content

class Notification:
    def __init__(self, user, content):
        self.user = user
        self.content = content

class Comment:
    def __init__(self, user, content):
        self.user = user
        self.content = content

class PrivacyList:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.members = []

class SearchEngine:
    def search_users(self, query):
        pass

    def search_groups(self, query):
        pass

    def search_pages(self, query):
        pass

    def search_posts(self, query):
        pass
```

This structure provides a foundation to build a Facebook-like social media platform. However, it is still a very basic design and does not cover all aspects of the system. A production-grade application would likely require many additional features, such as efficient storage and retrieval of data, security and privacy measures, data validation, and detailed error handling among others. Additionally, it would likely require a backend server and database, as well as a frontend user interface.

Let's add additional functionality, like the connection suggestion feature, to our existing model:

```python
class User:
    # Existing methods...

    def recommend_connections(self):
        """
        This function finds and recommends new connections for the user based on their current
        friends, groups and pages.
        """
        recommended_connections = []
        # Logic to recommend new connections...
        return recommended_connections
```

In the `recommend_connections` method, you could consider users who are friends with the user's friends but are not currently connected with the user themselves, or users who have similar group memberships or page followings.

You also asked for a more production-grade design. For that, let's consider how we could handle persistence (saving and retrieving data), add authentication, and add error handling:

1. **Persistence:** In a production-grade system, user information, posts, messages etc. would need to be saved to a database. The Python classes might interact with a database using an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) like SQLAlchemy, or directly via SQL queries. Each class might have methods like `save()`, `delete()`, `get_by_id()`, etc. to handle this.

2. **Authentication:** A system like this would require secure user authentication. You might have an `Authentication` class responsible for logging users in and out, registering new users, and checking user permissions. This could involve password hashing, session handling, and other security measures.

3. **Error Handling:** Each method should be prepared to handle errors gracefully. For instance, what if you try to add a friend who doesn't exist, or retrieve a post that has been deleted? These methods should have checks to handle such situations and return meaningful error messages.

Here is how we might add these enhancements to one of the classes:

```python
import sqlite3
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

class User:
    def __init__(self, name, password):
        self.name = name
        self.password_hash = generate_password_hash(password)
        self.friends = []
        self.posts = []

    def check_password(self, password):
        return check_password_hash(self.password_hash, password)

    def add_friend(self, other_user):
        if other_user not in self.friends:
            self.friends.append(other_user)
        else:
            raise Exception("This user is already your friend.")

    def create_post(self, content):
        new_post = Post(content)
        self.posts.append(new_post)
        new_post.save()

    def save(self):
        conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute(f"INSERT INTO users VALUES (?, ?)", (self.name, self.password_hash))
        conn.commit()
        conn.close()

    @classmethod
    def get_by_name(cls, name):
        conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        row = cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?", (name,)).fetchone()
        if row is None:
            raise Exception("User not found.")
        user = User(row[0], row[1])
        conn.close()
        return user

    # Existing methods...
```

This code is still a simplification of what a real system might look like. In a production-grade system, you might also want to consider:

- More sophisticated database handling, potentially including a dedicated data access layer or use of an ORM.
- Better password handling, including salting and password reset functionality.
- A framework like Flask or Django to handle HTTP requests and serve HTML pages or a REST API.
- More sophisticated error handling and logging.
- How to handle concurrent edits (e.g., two users who try to edit the same post at the same time).
- Testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
- Deployment and monitoring of your application.

For further design, I will implement a simple friend recommendation algorithm and some more methods:

```python
import sqlite3
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

class User:
    def __init__(self, name, password):
        self.name = name
        self.password_hash = generate_password_hash(password)
        self.friends = []
        self.posts = []

    def check_password(self, password):
        return check_password_hash(self.password_hash, password)

    def add_friend(self, other_user):
        if other_user not in self.friends:
            self.friends.append(other_user)
        else:
            raise Exception("This user is already your friend.")

    def remove_friend(self, other_user):
        if other_user in self.friends:
            self.friends.remove(other_user)
        else:
            raise Exception("This user is not your friend.")

    def create_post(self, content):
        new_post = Post(content)
        self.posts.append(new_post)
        new_post.save()

    def delete_post(self, post):
        if post in self.posts:
            self.posts.remove(post)
            post.delete()

    def recommend_connections(self):
        """
        This function finds and recommends new connections for the user based on their current
        friends. This algorithm simply suggests friends of friends who are not already connected with the user.
        """
        recommended_connections = []
        for friend in self.friends:
            for potential_connection in friend.friends:
                if potential_connection not in self.friends and potential_connection != self:
                    recommended_connections.append(potential_connection)
        return recommended_connections

    def save(self):
        conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute(f"INSERT INTO users (name, password_hash) VALUES (?, ?)", (self.name, self.password_hash))
        conn.commit()
        conn.close()

    @classmethod
    def get_by_name(cls, name):
        conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        row = cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?", (name,)).fetchone()
        if row is None:
            raise Exception("User not found.")
        user = User(row[0], row[1])
        conn.close()
        return user

class Post:
    def __init__(self, content):
        self.content = content

    def save(self):
        conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute(f"INSERT INTO posts (content) VALUES (?)", (self.content,))
        conn.commit()
        conn.close()

    def delete(self):
        conn = sqlite3.connect('my_database.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute(f"DELETE FROM posts WHERE content = ?", (self.content,))
        conn.commit()
        conn.close()
```

In this updated model:

- The `add_friend` method now throws an exception if the user is already a friend.
- I added a `remove_friend` method, which removes a friend from the user's friend list or throws an exception if the user is not a friend.
- The `create_post` method now saves the post to the database.
- I added a `delete_post` method, which removes a post from the user's list of posts and deletes it from the database.
- The `recommend_connections` method now recommends friends of the user's friends who are not already the user's friends. This is a very simple friend recommendation algorithm and could be made much more sophisticated in a real application.
- The `save` method now saves the user's name and password hash to the database.
- I added a `get_by_name` class method, which retrieves a user from the database by name.
- The `Post` class now has `save` and `delete` methods which save and delete a post to/from the database, respectively.
