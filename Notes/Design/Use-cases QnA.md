**Q. How would you design a tinyURL system?**

A hiring manager might ask this to allow you the opportunity to show your solid foundation in
design with a detailed explanation and a specific example. Prove your understanding that a
TinyURL is an URL service that creates a shorter, unique URL after users enter a long URL.
Consider focusing on other basics not listed in the example response like how you create a
unique ID for each URL, how you handle redirects and how you delete expired URLs.

Example: "When I was working for a public instant messaging site, I created a simple system
where every message was limited to 140 characters. It also necessitated shortened URLs of
about 30 characters. This TinyURL system is also useful when entering hyperlinks in emails or
on a smartphone, where there is room for error.

TinyURL is also a perfect example of the hashtag table. This data structure associates keys with
values and is a simple connections code. By using this basic 16-bit hash table, I was able to
optimise usability and meet the needs of the system."

**Q. How would you design a search engine?**

Sometimes search engines are needed within a specific department of a company to
systematically locate an item or important employee information. Hiring managers want to see
that you can tailor designs to the needs of the company. You can detail some of the overall
architecture of a search engine using the foundation below.

Example: "Before I relocated here, I created a search engine that performed keyword searches.
I began by building an indexer, which is a piece of software that crawls and produces results in
a data structure. The crawler would put web page links together and group them or dump them
into sets. I had the crawl set for H1 and H2, rather than H3s. I also checked outbound links to
avoid spammers. Lastly, I checked the serving results to verify that the design was working at
optimal capacity and relevancy."

**Q. How do you design a shared drive?**

Hiring managers ask this to explore algorithm basics and backgrounds. Before you begin, make
sure you understand the purpose of the task. Knowing if changes are be registered in real-time,
if locking is necessary and if the drive must be naturally convergent can help you give a
complete answer.

Example: "Shared drives work on differential synchronisation which keeps two or more copies
of the same document synchronised with each other in real-time. Therefore, if a change is made
in one version, the same alteration happens on all the others. It is a complex challenge, but
differential synchronisation is scalable and fault-tolerant. The three common approaches are
ownership, event passing and three-way merges.

I created a shared drive in my previous position to support in-house document sharing for one of
our clients. I used event-passing to allow for real-time collaboration, as the locking or ownership
approach would only allow the first one opening the document to make any adjustment. Using
this approach, their employees were able to work collaboratively even when out of the office or
on different schedules."

**Q. How would you incorporate microservices into an e-commerce platform?**

Microservices combine independent modules together to form a collaborative system instead of
using single or monolithic system construction. As businesses continue to use digital services.
Your interviewer may ask this question to determine your knowledge of industry trends and web
application architecture.

Example: "Microservices effectively customise e-commerce services for a business. In my
previous job, I helped customise e-commerce services for a gig hosting business that connected
administrative freelance contractors with companies seeking specific one-time services. Using
microservices, I was able to create an interconnected platform using API gateways throughout a
distributed system. This gave the company the opportunity to make updates quickly and offer
personalised dashboards to users."

**Q. How do you design a recommendation system?**

Recommendation systems help users find what they want more efficiently. They assist clients
and customers by offering alternatives and allowing for more choices. Hiring managers inquire
about this to see if you can create systems that are user friendly and focused.

Example: "One of my former clients found that their customers were struggling to find options
on their website. Their search had to be exact in order to find the product. I suggested we
implement a recommendation system to help with customer satisfaction and possibly sales.
Using the most prominent approach of collaborative filtering, I designed the system to weave a
sort of information tapestry that provided customers with suggestions based on user similarity.
The system became more user friendly and produced a 10% increase in sales for my client."
