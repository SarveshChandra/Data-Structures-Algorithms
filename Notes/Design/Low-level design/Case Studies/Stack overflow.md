# Stack Overflow

**Requirements**

1. Any non-member (guest) can search and view questions. However, to
add or upvote a question, they have to become a member.

2. Members should be able to post new questions.

3. Members should be able to add an answer to an open question.

4. Members can add comments to any question or answer.

5. A member can upvote a question, answer or comment.

6. Members can flag a question, answer or comment, for serious
problems or moderator attention.

7. Any member can add a bounty to their question to draw attention.

8. Members will earn badges for being helpful.

9. Members can vote to close a question; Moderators can close or
reopen any question.

10. Members can add tags to their questions. A tag is a word or phrase
that describes the topic of the question.

11. Members can vote to delete extremely off-topic or very low-quality
questions.

12. Moderators can close a question or undelete an already deleted
question.

13. The system should also be able to identify most frequently used tags
in the questions.

Let's define classes for each entity in our system:

1. `User`: This represents any user of the system. It will have details like username, email, password, etc. This class will also have methods for posting questions, answering questions, adding comments, upvoting, flagging, etc.

2. `Guest`: This class inherits from the User class. It represents users who are not members of the site and hence can only view and search questions.

3. `Member`: This class also inherits from User. It represents users who are registered members of the site and have additional privileges such as posting questions, answering questions, adding comments, upvoting, flagging, etc.

4. `Moderator`: This class inherits from Member. Moderators have additional privileges such as closing or reopening any question, undeleting questions, etc.

5. `Question`: This class represents a question posted on the platform. It contains the question text, tags, bounty, the user who posted it, answers, comments, etc.

6. `Answer`: This class represents an answer to a question. It contains the answer text, the user who posted it, comments, etc.

7. `Comment`: This class represents a comment on either a question or an answer.

8. `Tag`: This class represents a tag. Each question can have multiple tags.

Here are the class definitions:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class User:
    def __init__(self, username, email, password):
        self.username = username
        self.email = email
        self.password = password

class Guest(User):
    def search_question(self, question):
        # Implement search logic here

    def view_question(self, question):
        # Implement view logic here

class Member(User):
    def __init__(self, username, email, password):
        super().__init__(username, email, password)
        self.badges = []

    def post_question(self, question_text, tags):
        question = Question(question_text, self, tags)
        # Add question to database

    def answer_question(self, question, answer_text):
        answer = Answer(answer_text, self)
        question.answers.append(answer)

    def add_comment(self, text, question=None, answer=None):
        comment = Comment(text, self)
        if question:
            question.comments.append(comment)
        elif answer:
            answer.comments.append(comment)

    def upvote(self, question=None, answer=None, comment=None):
        # Implement upvote logic here

    def flag(self, question=None, answer=None, comment=None):
        # Implement flag logic here

    def add_bounty(self, question, bounty):
        question.bounty += bounty

class Moderator(Member):
    def close_question(self, question):
        question.status = "Closed"

    def reopen_question(self, question):
        question.status = "Open"

    def undelete_question(self, question):
        question.status = "Open"

class Question:
    def __init__(self, text, posted_by, tags):
        self.text = text
        self.posted_by = posted_by
        self.tags = tags
        self.answers = []
        self.comments = []
        self.status = "Open"
        self.bounty = 0

class Answer:
    def __init__(self, text, posted_by):
        self.text = text
        self.posted_by = posted_by
        self.comments = []

class Comment:
    def __init__(self, text, posted_by):
        self.text = text
        self.posted_by = posted_by

class Tag:
    def __init__(self, text):
        self.text = text
```

This is a basic implementation and doesn't include all the details. In a real-world application, you would need to handle more edge cases, implement proper error checking and handling, secure the system, optimize for performance, etc.
