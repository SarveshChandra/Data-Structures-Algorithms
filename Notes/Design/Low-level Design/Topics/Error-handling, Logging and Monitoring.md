# Error-Handling, Logging and Monitoring

Sure, error-handling, logging, and monitoring are essential parts of software development and low-level design. Let's discuss each of these aspects.

**1. Error Handling:** Error handling is the process of responding to exceptions â€“ conditions that disrupt the normal flow of a program. The primary goal of error handling is to prevent your program from crashing when an exception occurs.

Python uses a system of built-in exceptions and exception handling keywords for this purpose. You can `raise` an exception in your code, `try` to run code that might raise an exception, `except` a raised exception, and `finally` run cleanup code whether an exception was raised or not.

For example:

```python
try:
    x = 1 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    x = 0  # Handle the error by setting x to 0
finally:
    print("Cleanup code goes here.")
```

**2. Logging:** Logging is the practice of recording information about your program's execution for debugging and auditing purposes. It's usually done with the help of a logging library.

Python's built-in `logging` module is widely used for this purpose:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logging.debug("This is a debug message")  # Will not be printed
logging.info("This is an info message")  # Will be printed
```

Logs can be written to files for persistent storage, and can include a variety of information such as timestamps, error messages, information about the current execution context, etc.

**3. Monitoring:** Monitoring is the practice of collecting, processing, aggregating, and displaying real-time information about a system. 

In a Python application, you might use a library like `psutil` to collect system statistics, a service like StatsD or Prometheus to aggregate your statistics, and a service like Graphite or Grafana to display your statistics.

Monitoring can provide insights about the runtime behavior of your application and can help you identify performance bottlenecks, resource usage patterns, and potential points of failure.

In terms of low-level design, you'll want to consider:

- What conditions should be considered errors in each part of your system.
- What information to include in log messages and when to log them.
- What aspects of your system to monitor, how to collect that data, and how to interpret it.

Remember, proper error handling, logging, and monitoring can greatly improve the maintainability and reliability of a system. Therefore, they should be integral parts of your design and implementation process.

Sure, here are some more advanced examples in Python for error-handling, logging and monitoring:

1. **Advanced Error Handling:**
   In Python, you can define your own custom exceptions which can carry more information about the error occurred. Here is an example:

   ```python
   class CustomError(Exception):
       def __init__(self, message, status_code):
           super().__init__(message)
           self.status_code = status_code
   
   try:
       raise CustomError("This is a custom error", 500)
   except CustomError as e:
       print(f"Caught an error: {e}, status_code: {e.status_code}")
   ```

   In this example, `CustomError` is a user-defined exception that carries an additional `status_code` attribute. When this exception is raised, both the error message and the status code can be caught and handled in the `except` block.

2. **Advanced Logging:**
   The Python logging module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs. Here is an example that logs both to a file and the console:

   ```python
   import logging

   # Create a logger
   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
   logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

   # Create a file handler
   handler = logging.FileHandler('hello.log')
   handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)

   # Create a logging format
   formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
   handler.setFormatter(formatter)

   # Add the handlers to the logger
   logger.addHandler(handler)

   logger.info('Hello, world!')
   ```

   In this example, the logger is set to log all messages with a severity level of INFO or higher, and the log messages are written to the `hello.log` file with a specific format.

3. **Monitoring:**
   Monitoring an application often involves collecting metrics about the application and the system it runs on. Here's an example of how you could use the `psutil` library in Python to monitor CPU usage:

   ```python
   import psutil
   import time

   while True:
       print(f'CPU usage: {psutil.cpu_percent()}%')
       time.sleep(1)
   ```

   This script continuously prints the current CPU usage percentage. Please note, actual production-grade monitoring would involve a lot more sophisticated system which might be using third-party services like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack(Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), etc. to store and visualize the metrics. 

Remember, these are simplified examples, and actual production code can be a lot more complex depending on the requirements and constraints of your application. Always refer to the official documentation and best practices when writing production-grade code.

## QnAs

Sure, here are some potential interview questions and answers related to Error-Handling, Logging, and Monitoring in Low-Level System Design:

1. **What is exception handling and why is it important in system design?**

   Exception handling is a process that responds to the occurrence of exceptions - abnormal or unexpected conditions requiring special processing - during the execution of a program. In system design, it's crucial because it helps to manage errors and unusual situations, ensuring that the system can continue to function or fail gracefully under problematic conditions, enhancing reliability and robustness.

2. **What's the difference between logging and monitoring in a system?**

   Logging is the process of recording events occurring in a system, typically involving system activities or user actions, which can be used later for troubleshooting and auditing. On the other hand, monitoring involves continuously watching over the operation of a system in real time to ensure it's functioning correctly and to identify any potential issues as soon as they occur. While logging can provide historical data about the system's behavior, monitoring provides real-time information about the system's current state.

3. **Why is centralized logging important in a distributed system?**

   In a distributed system, where different parts of a system are located on separate hardware, centralized logging is crucial. It allows all logs from various components of the system to be collected and stored in one place, making it much easier to correlate events happening across the system, track down issues, and perform comprehensive analysis of the logs.

4. **How does error handling contribute to the user experience?**

   Proper error handling is critical to a good user experience. When errors are handled appropriately, users can be informed about the issue in a friendly and understandable way, often with suggestions on what to do next, rather than confronting them with cryptic error messages. Also, effective error handling can help prevent a system from completely failing when an error occurs, enabling a more seamless user experience.

5. **What are some common practices to follow while setting up a monitoring system?**

   Some of the common practices for setting up a monitoring system are: Define what key metrics and system behaviors need to be monitored; Ensure the monitoring tools can scale as the system grows; Use automated alerting to notify the responsible teams when certain thresholds are crossed or incidents occur; Incorporate a dashboard to visually represent the system's status; and finally, continuously review and adjust the monitoring strategy to adapt to the evolving system and its requirements.

Certainly, here are some additional interview questions and answers on Error-Handling, Logging, and Monitoring in Low-Level System Design:

1. **What is the role of a logging level in a system and how can it be used effectively?**

   A logging level in a system determines the severity of messages that the system will log. Common logging levels include DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL. Using these levels effectively can help developers tune the amount and detail of log data. For instance, in a production environment, you might only log WARN, ERROR, and FATAL messages to avoid log files becoming too large. During development or troubleshooting, you might enable DEBUG and INFO levels to gather more detailed information about the system's behavior.

2. **How would you design a system to automatically recover from a failure?**

   Automatic recovery from failures is an important part of system design. This can be achieved through several mechanisms, such as:
   
   - **Retries**: Implementing automatic retries with exponential backoff and jitter for transient errors can help the system recover without manual intervention.
   
   - **Fallbacks**: For some types of errors, it can be helpful to have a fallback solution in place. For example, if a call to a remote service fails, the system might use cached data as a fallback.

   - **Health Checks and Self-healing**: Regular health checks can detect issues early. If a health check fails, the system could try to restart the faulty component or spin up a new instance to replace it.

3. **What are some strategies to ensure logs are not lost when a system crashes?**

   Some strategies to avoid losing logs during a system crash include:

   - **Persisting Logs**: Writing logs to a persistent storage system can ensure they survive a crash. This could be a database, a log management system, or a distributed filesystem.

   - **Log Forwarding**: Using a log forwarder, logs can be sent to a remote server or service for safekeeping in real-time or near-real-time. This ensures that even if the local system crashes, the logs are preserved.

   - **Redundancy**: Keeping redundant copies of logs can also prevent loss during system crashes. This might involve replicating logs across multiple machines or backing up logs at regular intervals.

4. **What types of errors would you expect to handle in a distributed system, and how might you handle them?**

   Distributed systems have unique challenges and errors that need handling. Examples include network failures, machine crashes, and race conditions. Strategies for handling these might include implementing timeouts and retries for network requests, using health checks and redundancy to cope with machine failures, and using locks or optimistic concurrency control to handle race conditions.

5. **What are some key metrics you might monitor in a web application?**

   Some key metrics to monitor in a web application might include:

   - **Performance Metrics**: Such as request rate, error rate, response times, and resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network I/O).

   - **Business Metrics**: Such as user signups, active users, orders placed, and revenue.

   - **Infrastructure Metrics**: Such as server health, database performance, and third-party service status.

   - **User Experience Metrics**: Such as page load times, UI responsiveness, and error rates seen by users.
