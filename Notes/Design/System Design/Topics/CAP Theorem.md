# CAP Theorem

The CAP Theorem is a fundamental concept in distributed computing and system design. The theorem was proposed by Eric Brewer in 2000 and formally proven by Seth Gilbert and Nancy Lynch in 2002.

CAP stands for Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance, and the theorem states that a distributed system can only guarantee two of these three properties at any given time.

Let's explore each aspect:

**1. Consistency**: This means that all nodes in a distributed system see the same data at the same time. Simply put, a read request to the system always returns the value of the most recent write operation. This is a very desirable property in distributed systems.

**2. Availability**: Every request received by a non-failing node in the system must result in a response. It doesn't matter what the state of the system is; it should always process the request and return a valid response. 

**3. Partition Tolerance**: This implies that the system continues to operate, despite the number of messages being delayed by the network between nodes. A system that is partition-tolerant can sustain any amount of network failure that doesn't result in a failure of the entire network. 

According to the CAP theorem, a distributed system cannot achieve all three CAP properties simultaneously. This is because in real-world networks, partitions (network failures) can occur, and during a partition, it's impossible to provide both absolute consistency and availability, leading to a trade-off between those two properties.

Different databases and distributed systems make different trade-offs:

- **CA (Consistency and Availability)**: In a CA system, there are no network partitions, so it offers consistency and availability. This is typical of traditional single-server databases. However, it's important to remember that, in reality, network partitions can happen, making pure CA systems hypothetical in nature.

- **CP (Consistency and Partition Tolerance)**: In a CP system, the system opts to maintain consistency over availability. This means that in case of a network partition, the system will shut down the non-consistent partition such that it remains consistent throughout. Examples of CP systems include HBase and BigTable.

- **AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance)**: In an AP system, the system ensures that every request receives a response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write. During a network partition, an AP system will continue to operate but it sacrifices consistency. Examples of AP systems include DynamoDB and Cassandra.

The CAP theorem helps designers of distributed systems by introducing them to the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. System architects can use the CAP theorem as a guide to determine which trade-offs are most appropriate based on specific system requirements and constraints.

The CAP Theorem is often used as a framework for understanding the trade-offs that a system can make in the face of network partition or failure, but it's important to remember that it's a simplification of the realities of distributed computing. In practice, many systems dynamically shift between these properties as conditions change, and some systems may allow for tunable consistency or availability depending on the specific needs of the application.

**Consistency Models**: Not all systems require strict consistency. Some systems may be okay with eventual consistency, where updates to a piece of data will eventually reach all nodes in the system, or causal consistency, where updates that are causally related will be applied in the same order everywhere, but updates that are not causally related may not be.

**High Availability and Network Partitions**: While network partitions are generally seen as rare, they can and do occur in distributed systems. If your system must be highly available, meaning it must keep serving requests even in the event of a network partition, then you need to design it with partition tolerance in mind. In such a case, you may have to accept that you can't also have strict consistency.

**Real-world CAP Examples**:
Here are some real-world examples of how different databases handle the CAP trade-offs:

- **Cassandra**: Cassandra prioritizes availability over consistency. It is typically classified as an AP system under CAP. However, Cassandra provides tunable consistency, allowing you to decide how strong or weak you want the consistency to be on a per-operation basis. 

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a CP system, it chooses consistency over availability. During a network partition, MongoDB will continue to operate but will refuse to execute queries that could result in inconsistency.

- **CouchDB**: CouchDB is an AP system that also focuses on partition tolerance and availability, at the expense of consistency. However, CouchDB also provides eventual consistency.

**Conclusion**:
Designing distributed systems is a complex task that involves understanding and managing trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. The CAP theorem serves as a useful model to understand these trade-offs. However, in practice, the lines can be blurred, and many systems provide ways to tune the balance between consistency and availability to suit specific use cases and requirements.

Sure, let's discuss some examples to understand the CAP theorem better. 

Consider a distributed data storage system, such as a global online retail platform. Here are three scenarios that demonstrate the three aspects of the CAP theorem:

1. **Consistency and Availability (CA)**:
   Imagine a scenario where there are no network failures (hence, no need for Partition Tolerance). Let's say you have multiple data centers around the world for your global online retail platform, and there is a perfect and reliable network between them, with no delays or partitions. In such a case, when a customer makes a change to their shopping cart in one data center, that change is instantly reflected across all data centers (Consistency). Moreover, all requests for information receive a response, and the system is always available (Availability). However, this scenario is idealistic, as real-world systems do experience network failures and delays.

2. **Consistency and Partition Tolerance (CP)**:
   Now consider that our online retail platform experiences a network partition between two data centers. In this case, if we want to maintain Consistency across the system, we might choose to make one partition (or even the entire system) unavailable until the partition is resolved. For example, the platform might prevent customers in the affected partition from making changes to their shopping cart until the network issue is fixed. This way, we ensure the same data is seen across the whole system (Consistency), and the system continues working despite the network partition (Partition Tolerance), but it is not available for all users during the partition.

3. **Availability and Partition Tolerance (AP)**:
   In the case of a network partition, if we prioritize availability, we might allow customers to continue making changes to their shopping carts on all data centers, despite the network partition. This would mean the system is still available for all users (Availability) and continues working despite the network partition (Partition Tolerance), but it sacrifices Consistency. Some customers might not see the most recent changes to their shopping cart until after the network partition is resolved. 

In the real world, many popular distributed databases have to make trade-offs due to the CAP theorem:

- **Amazon's DynamoDB** is designed to prioritize Availability and Partition Tolerance. It allows you to tune the consistency level, but its default behavior (and the behavior during network partitions) is to offer eventual consistency.

- **Google's BigTable**, on the other hand, is designed to prioritize Consistency and Partition Tolerance. During a network partition, it opts to preserve data consistency across the system at the expense of full availability.

Remember, the CAP theorem doesn't say that you get to pick two out of the three properties and completely ignore the third. Instead, it indicates that in the case of a network partition, you have to make a trade-off between consistency and availability. All distributed systems have to be partition-tolerant to some degree because network failures can and do occur. The choice is between favoring consistency or availability when those failures happen.

Certainly! Let's look at some specific real-world examples of distributed databases and see where they fall in the CAP theorem:

1. **Google Cloud Datastore (CP)**: Google Cloud Datastore is a highly scalable NoSQL database for web and mobile applications. It is designed around the concept of strong consistency, meaning all reads will see all writes, provided the writes have completed before the reads are started. In the event of a network partition, Google Cloud Datastore will maintain consistency at the expense of availability.

2. **Amazon DynamoDB (AP)**: Amazon's DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It's designed to prioritize availability and partition tolerance. By default, when you read data from DynamoDB, you might not see the latest data. However, DynamoDB offers a feature called "strongly consistent reads," which, when turned on, a successful response to a read operation will always reflect all writes that received a successful response before the read operation started.

3. **Apache Cassandra (AP)**: Apache Cassandra is a distributed NoSQL database intended for managing large amounts of structured data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. In the event of a network partition, Cassandra chooses to remain available, sacrificing consistency.

4. **MongoDB (CP)**: MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB favors consistency and partition tolerance. In the event of a network partition, a subset of the nodes might be unavailable, but the rest of the system continues to operate and maintains consistency.

5. **CouchDB (AP)**: Apache CouchDB is a database that uses JSON for documents, JavaScript for MapReduce indexes, and regular HTTP for its API. CouchDB is designed with offline operation and synchronization in mind, and that makes it a good example of an AP system. CouchDB replicates and remains available during network partitions, at the expense of consistency.

Remember, these categorizations in CAP are simplifications, and real-world behavior can be much more complex. These systems often offer tunable parameters to adjust their behavior under certain conditions. Therefore, they don't strictly adhere to just one or two of the CAP properties but can adjust according to the needs of the specific application they're serving.

## QnAs

Sure, let's go over some common interview questions on distributed databases, the CAP theorem, and related topics. 

1. **Question**: Can you explain the CAP theorem? 
   **Answer**: The CAP theorem is a fundamental principle in distributed systems that states it's impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. Consistency ensures that all nodes see the same data at the same time. Availability guarantees that every request receives a response without guaranteeing it to be the latest copy of the data. Partition Tolerance means the system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures.

2. **Question**: Can you provide examples of databases and whether they are CA, CP, or AP systems? 
   **Answer**: Google's BigTable is an example of a CP system, which values consistency and partition tolerance over availability. On the other hand, Amazon's DynamoDB and Apache Cassandra are examples of AP systems, prioritizing availability and partition tolerance over consistency. MongoDB is another CP system. These categorizations can be nuanced as these databases often provide mechanisms to adjust their behavior based on the specific needs of the system they're serving.

3. **Question**: When might you prefer an AP system over a CP system, or vice versa?
   **Answer**: The choice between an AP system and a CP system depends on the specific requirements of your application. If your application needs to always be up and can tolerate not having the most recent data immediately (for example, in a social media app where a slight delay in propagating a post is acceptable), you might prefer an AP system like Apache Cassandra. However, if your application needs strong consistency (for example, a banking app where you always need the exact amount of money in an account), a CP system like Google's BigTable or MongoDB may be a better choice.

4. **Question**: What do you understand by the term "eventual consistency"? 
   **Answer**: Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in distributed computing to achieve high availability. It informally guarantees that, if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the latest updated value. This model is useful for applications where consistency over a short amount of time is not as important as the system's ability to continue working during network partitions.

5. **Question**: How does partition tolerance affect the design of a distributed system?
   **Answer**: Partition tolerance refers to a system's ability to continue functioning in spite of network partitions or failures. When designing a distributed system, one must assume that network partitions can and will occur. The system needs to be able to handle these partitions gracefully, and it's here where we have to consider the trade-off between consistency and availability. During a partition, a system can either provide consistency at the expense of availability (CP), or it can provide availability at the expense of consistency (AP). The specific requirements of your application will determine which of these trade-offs is more suitable. 

Remember, these are example answers and the exact response can vary based on the specific scenario, database, or system you're discussing.

Sure, here are some additional potential interview questions related to CAP Theorem and system design:

1. **Question**: What is the difference between Strong Consistency and Eventual Consistency? 
   **Answer**: Strong consistency ensures that any read operation will always return the most recent write made by any client, making sure that all users always see the same data. Eventual consistency is a more relaxed model, where the system does not guarantee that all participants will see the same data at the same time. However, the system does guarantee that in the absence of any updates, eventually all participants will see the same data.

2. **Question**: How does a distributed system handle a network partition?
   **Answer**: When a network partition occurs in a distributed system, the system needs to choose between consistency and availability, as per the CAP theorem. Some systems choose to prioritize availability, allowing all nodes to continue accepting read and write operations, even if that means some nodes may have stale data. This can lead to eventual consistency when the partition is resolved. Other systems may choose to prioritize consistency, blocking operations to certain nodes to ensure that all remaining nodes have the most up-to-date data. This might mean the system is partially unavailable during the partition.

3. **Question**: What is a real-world use case where you might prefer an AP (Availability/Partition Tolerance) system over a CP (Consistency/Partition Tolerance) system?
   **Answer**: An example of a use case where you might prefer an AP system could be a microblogging site like Twitter. In such an application, it's more important that the system is always available to accept tweets (write operations) and show tweets (read operations), even if some users might see slightly stale data for a short period. 

4. **Question**: Can you describe how partition tolerance can impact system availability in a distributed database?
   **Answer**: In a distributed database, network partitions can severely impact system availability if the database prioritizes consistency over availability. For instance, if a partition separates a few nodes from the rest of the network, a consistency-preferring system may choose to make the separated nodes (or even the whole system) unavailable to ensure that no inconsistent data is read or written. On the other hand, a system that prioritizes availability over consistency will continue to serve requests on all nodes, despite the risk of data inconsistency. 

5. **Question**: Can you give an example of a real-world system that favors Consistency over Availability, and describe why?
   **Answer**: A bank's financial system is a classic example where consistency is favored over availability. In banking, it's crucial that transactions are processed in a consistent order and that the balance of any given account is always accurate. In the event of a network partition, a bank might choose to halt operations rather than risk processing transactions inconsistently, even though this means the system is not fully available.
