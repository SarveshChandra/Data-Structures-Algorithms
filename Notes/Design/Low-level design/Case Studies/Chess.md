# Chess

**Requirements**

1. The system should support two online players to play a game of
chess.
2. All rules of international chess will be followed.
3. Each player will be randomly assigned a side, black or white.
4. Both players will play their moves one after the other. The white side
plays the first move.
5. Players canâ€™t cancel or roll back their moves.
6. The system should maintain a log of all moves by both players.
7. Each side will start with 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, 1
queen, and 1 king.
8. The game can finish either in a checkmate from one side, forfeit or
stalemate (a draw), or resignation.

Here is a basic design that meets your requirements:

**1. Class Player:**

This class represents a player. Each player has a `color`, and `isInCheck` which denotes if the player's king is in check. The `hasLost` attribute signifies if the player has lost the game.

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color
        self.isInCheck = False
        self.hasLost = False
```

**2. Class Game:**

This class encapsulates a game. It has two players, a `board` that represents the current state of the game, and a `log` that keeps track of all moves.

```python
class Game:
    def __init__(self, player1, player2):
        self.player1 = player1
        self.player2 = player2
        self.board = Board()
        self.log = []

    def play(self):
        while not self.gameOver():
            # logic for players making moves and updating the board/log
            pass

    def gameOver(self):
        # checks if the game is over due to checkmate, stalemate, or resignation
        pass
```

**3. Class Board:**

This class represents the chessboard, which consists of 64 squares and an initial set up of pieces.

```python
class Board:
    def __init__(self):
        self.setup()

    def setup(self):
        self.squares = [[None]*8 for _ in range(8)]
        # Logic to add pieces to their initial positions
        pass

    def movePiece(self, move):
        # Logic to move a piece if the move is valid
        pass
```

**4. Class Piece:**

This class represents a generic piece. Every piece has a color and a type.

```python
class Piece:
    def __init__(self, color, type):
        self.color = color
        self.type = type
```

**5. Class Move:**

This class represents a move, which includes the piece being moved, the start square, the destination square, and whether or not the move is a capture of an enemy piece.

```python
class Move:
    def __init__(self, piece, start, destination):
        self.piece = piece
        self.start = start
        self.destination = destination
        self.isCapture = False  # Updated later if this move is a capture
```

This design provides a high-level overview of the classes needed to implement the game of chess according to your requirements. To make this a production-grade system, you would need to add methods to validate moves according to the rules of chess, handle special moves like castling and en passant, manage the state of the game, and handle user inputs and game outputs.

Keep in mind that building a chess game from scratch is quite complex, and this is a very basic starting point. It does not cover the rules of each piece, handling the end of the game, or the user interface, which are all necessary for a complete game.

Expanding on the previous design, we'll refine and add more details:

**1. Class Player**

We'll include a `name` attribute and a method to make a move:

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, color):
        self.name = name
        self.color = color
        self.isInCheck = False
        self.hasLost = False

    def makeMove(self, start, destination):
        return Move(start, destination)
```

**2. Class Game**

The `play` method is responsible for the flow of the game:

```python
class Game:
    def __init__(self, player1, player2):
        self.player1 = player1
        self.player2 = player2
        self.board = Board()
        self.log = []

    def play(self):
        while not self.gameOver():
            for player in [self.player1, self.player2]:
                move = player.makeMove(start, destination)
                if self.board.validateMove(move):
                    self.board.movePiece(move)
                    self.log.append(move)
                if self.board.checkMate(player):
                    player.hasLost = True
                    break

    def gameOver(self):
        return self.player1.hasLost or self.player2.hasLost
```

**3. Class Board**

Added methods to validate a move and to check if a player is in checkmate:

```python
class Board:
    def __init__(self):
        self.setup()

    def setup(self):
        self.squares = [[None]*8 for _ in range(8)]
        # Logic to add pieces to their initial positions
        pass

    def movePiece(self, move):
        self.squares[move.start] = None
        self.squares[move.destination] = move.piece

    def validateMove(self, move):
        # Validate the move according to chess rules
        pass

    def checkMate(self, player):
        # Check if a player is in checkmate
        pass
```

**4. Class Piece**

Add possible movements for each type of piece:

```python
class Piece:
    def __init__(self, color, type):
        self.color = color
        self.type = type

    def getPossibleMoves(self):
        # Return a list of possible moves for this piece
        pass
```

**5. Class Move**

No changes are needed to this class for now.

```python
class Move:
    def __init__(self, piece, start, destination):
        self.piece = piece
        self.start = start
        self.destination = destination
        self.isCapture = False
```

This design is a bit more concrete but still leaves a lot of the specifics of chess rules unimplemented. The rules of chess are very complex, and each piece has unique movement rules, not to mention special moves like castling, en passant, and promotion. The game loop logic is also quite simplified and does not handle things like player input or a graphical user interface. Furthermore, it does not provide networking capabilities for online play. Each of these would significantly complicate the design.

To develop the design of our chess game further, let's add the following:

1. More specific classes for each type of Piece.
2. Handling for special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
3. Networking capabilities for online play.

**1. Piece and its subclasses**

Instead of having a single Piece class with a type attribute, let's make Piece an abstract base class and create subclasses for each type of piece. This way, each Piece subclass can implement its own logic for valid moves.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Piece(ABC):
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color

    @abstractmethod
    def valid_moves(self, board):
        pass

class King(Piece):
    def valid_moves(self, board):
        # Return all valid moves for a king on the given board
        pass

# Do the same for Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Pawn
```

**2. Special moves**

To handle special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion, you could add additional logic in the `valid_moves` methods of the relevant Piece subclasses and in the Board's `movePiece` method.

**3. Networking for online play**

Adding networking capabilities for online play is a substantial task and involves many considerations outside the scope of the chess game itself, such as server architecture, client-server communication protocol, and security.

Here is a simple example of how you might start implementing a server-client architecture:

```python
import socket

class ChessServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.host = 'localhost'
        self.port = 5000
        self.server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        self.server_socket.bind((self.host, self.port))
        self.clients = []

    def listen_for_clients(self):
        self.server_socket.listen(2)
        while True:
            client_socket, address = self.server_socket.accept()
            self.clients.append(client_socket)
            print(f"Connection from {address} has been established!")

    def broadcast(self, message):
        for client_socket in self.clients:
            client_socket.send(message)

class ChessClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.host = 'localhost'
        self.port = 5000
        self.client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    def connect_to_server(self):
        self.client_socket.connect((self.host, self.port))

    def send_move(self, move):
        self.client_socket.send(move)

    def receive_move(self):
        return self.client_socket.recv(1024)
```

In this example, the ChessServer listens for connections from two clients and can broadcast messages (such as moves) to all connected clients. The ChessClient can connect to the server and send/receive messages.

This design is still quite simplified and doesn't include many things you would need in a production-grade chess game, such as error handling, game state synchronization between server and clients, matchmaking system, and user interfaces. It's also worth noting that this server-client implementation is blocking and could be made more efficient using threading or asynchronous I/O.

In order to take the chess game design to the next level, we can incorporate features like:

1. Game Timer
2. Player Profile & Rating System
3. Game Save and Replay

**1. Game Timer**

Chess games, especially online ones, often have time controls to ensure the game progresses at a reasonable pace. This could be easily implemented by adding a timer to each player and a method in the Game class to check if a player has run out of time.

```python
class Timer:
    def __init__(self, total_time):
        self.total_time = total_time
        self.time_left = total_time

    def tick(self, seconds):
        self.time_left -= seconds

class Player:
    # Other attributes and methods
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color
        self.timer = Timer(1800)  # 30-minute timer for example

class Game:
    # Other attributes and methods
    def check_time(self):
        if self.white_player.timer.time_left <= 0:
            return 'Black'
        elif self.black_player.timer.time_left <= 0:
            return 'White'
        else:
            return None
```

**2. Player Profile & Rating System**

To make the game more competitive, we can add a player profile and rating system. This will allow players to track their progress and aim to improve their skills.

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, color, username):
        self.color = color
        self.username = username
        self.rating = 1200  # Starting rating

class RatingSystem:
    @staticmethod
    def update_rating(winner: Player, loser: Player):
        # Update ratings based on a match result
        pass
```

**3. Game Save and Replay**

It could be useful to save a game so that it can be reviewed or continued later. This requires maintaining a history of moves and a method to load a game from history.

```python
class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = Board()
        self.history = []

    def save_game(self):
        with open(f'{self.white_player.username}_vs_{self.black_player.username}.txt', 'w') as f:
            for move in self.history:
                f.write(f'{move}\n')

    @staticmethod
    def load_game(file_name):
        game = Game()
        with open(file_name, 'r') as f:
            for line in f:
                move = line.strip()
                game.board.movePiece(move)
                game.history.append(move)
        return game
```

Please note that these enhancements make the design more complex and there are many details left to fill in. This includes error handling, concurrency issues for multiplayer games, security for player data, and a frontend interface to interact with the game.

Sure, here are the additions to the design considering the new requirements:

**1. Error Handling:**

We need to ensure that all errors are handled in a way that doesn't disrupt the game or expose sensitive information. We can add exception handling to our classes to capture and deal with any errors that occur. For example:

```python
class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        try:
            self.board = Board()
            self.history = []
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")

    def save_game(self):
        try:
            with open(f'{self.white_player.username}_vs_{self.black_player.username}.txt', 'w') as f:
                for move in self.history:
                    f.write(f'{move}\n')
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred while saving the game: {str(e)}")
```

**2. Game State Synchronization:**

Game state synchronization between the server and the clients is important to ensure that both the players are seeing the same state of the game. In order to achieve this, we can use a protocol like WebSockets to maintain a live connection with the client, and push updates to the client whenever the game state changes. We would need a new class, GameState, which would represent the current state of the game, and would be transmitted to the clients whenever it changes.

```python
class GameState:
    def __init__(self, board, white_player, black_player):
        self.board = board
        self.white_player = white_player
        self.black_player = black_player

    def to_json(self):
        return json.dumps(self, default=lambda o: o.__dict__)
```

**3. Matchmaking System:**

We can add a Matchmaking class that maintains a list of players looking for a game and pairs them together based on certain criteria like their ratings or the time they've been waiting.

```python
class Matchmaking:
    def __init__(self):
        self.players_looking_for_game = []

    def add_player(self, player):
        self.players_looking_for_game.append(player)
        self.match_players()

    def match_players(self):
        # Logic to match players based on criteria
        pass
```

Note: In a real-world application, the matchmaking system could get quite complex, as it could involve algorithms to ensure fair matching, player preferences for the type of match they want, etc. Also, the game state synchronization would likely be handled by a dedicated server or a backend service, rather than being embedded directly in the Game class.

This is still a simplified design and there are many details left to fill in. For instance, you'd likely want to use a database or persistent storage to keep track of players and games, and the matchmaking system would need to be much more sophisticated to efficiently handle a large number of players. Additionally, robust security measures would be necessary to protect player data and prevent cheating. A complete, production-grade chess game system would likely involve a distributed system architecture and could include numerous other features such as chat, spectating, leaderboards, tournaments, etc.
