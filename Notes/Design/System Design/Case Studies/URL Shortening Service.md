# URL Shortening Service like TinyURL

To design a production-grade URL shortening service like TinyURL, we would need to address a variety of factors. Let's break it down:

## High-Level System Design
At a high level, the system could be composed of the following components:

1. **Web Server**: The web server would handle incoming HTTP requests from the clients. It would handle client interaction UI for generating and retrieving URLs.
2. **Application Server**: The application server would handle the business logic, such as generating the shortened URL, redirection to the original URL, etc.
3. **Database**: The database stores the mapping of shortened URLs to their original URLs, and additional information such as creation time, expiration time, and usage statistics.
4. **Cache**: A cache layer to speed up common lookups and reduce the load on the database.
5. **Background Worker and Queue**: To handle long-running or periodic tasks such as the cleanup of expired URLs.
6. **API Gateway**: An API gateway to expose the functionality to other services.

## Key Components Design
Now let's delve deeper into the design of key components:

### URL Generation
We could use a simple auto-incrementing ID for each new URL and convert that to a base62 (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) string to serve as our shortened URL. However, this could lead to predictability. To overcome this, we could introduce randomization or hashing.

Custom URLs could be handled similarly - the system would need to check if the chosen custom URL is already in use, and if not, reserve it for the user's chosen URL.

### Data Model
We can have a table 'URL' with the following schema:

- `id`: a 64-bit integer
- `original_url`: a string (max 2048 characters)
- `shortened_url`: a string (max 8 characters)
- `creation_time`: a timestamp
- `expiration_time`: a timestamp
- `access_count`: an integer
- `custom_alias`: a string (max 8 characters)

### Redirection
When the application server receives a request to access a shortened URL, it would look up the 'URL' table, check if the URL is expired, increment the access count, and then return a HTTP 301 (Permanent Redirect) status to the client, with the original URL.

### Expiration
Expired URLs could be handled by a background worker. The worker would periodically scan the table for URLs past their expiration time and delete them. To reduce the load of this operation, we can partition the data by the creation time.

### Caching
We could use a cache like Redis to store a hot subset of the URL mappings. This would allow us to minimize database lookups for popular URLs. When a lookup occurs, the system would first check the cache before falling back to the database.

### Analytics
We could keep a counter in each URL's database entry that gets incremented every time the URL gets accessed. This would provide a basic hit count.

### REST API
The functionality could be exposed through RESTful APIs. For instance, a POST request could be used to create a new shortened URL, and a GET request could retrieve the details of a given shortened URL.

## Non-Functional Requirements
To ensure high availability and minimal latency, we could consider the following:

1. **Load Balancer**: Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
2. **Database Replication**: Use database replication to have multiple copies of the data, increasing data availability and reliability.
3. **Database Partitioning**: Use database partitioning (sharding) to distribute the data across multiple databases. This could also help to distribute read/write operations and reduce latency.

To ensure that shortened links are not predictable, we can use hashing and introduce randomness while generating the short URL.

## Trade-Offs
The above design tries to balance performance, reliability, and complexity. There are always trade-offs in such a design. For example, maintaining high availability and low latency might lead to increased system complexity and operational cost. Similarly, using caches to speed up lookups could lead to issues with data consistency if not managed properly. It is essential to keep these trade-offs in mind while building the system.

This is a broad overview of how the URL shortening service could be designed. The actual implementation details would vary based on specific requirements and constraints.






large scale

Certainly, designing a URL shortening service for a large scale involves considering a few more aspects like performance, scalability, and data integrity. Here's a more detailed perspective:

## Web Servers and Application Servers
To handle a high number of requests concurrently, the service will need multiple web servers. Incoming requests should be distributed amongst these servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck. This could be achieved through load balancers.

Load balancers distribute network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server bears too much load. This also adds redundancy, improving availability and reliability.

## Database
The primary requirement for the database is to store mappings from shortened URLs to original URLs. We need a database that can support a high number of writes and reads.

Using a relational database like MySQL is a good start, but as the number of URLs increases, it might become necessary to partition the data across multiple databases or instances - a technique known as sharding. Sharding based on the hashed value of the short URL can be an effective strategy.

Another consideration is database replication - maintaining multiple copies of the data to improve read performance and reliability. Replicas can also serve as hot-standbys if the primary database fails.

## Caching
Caching is essential for improving the performance of reads. When a URL redirection request comes in, the system first checks the cache for the corresponding original URL. If it's not there, it queries the database, then stores the result in the cache for future lookups.

A common approach is to use an in-memory datastore like Redis or Memcached for caching. These datastores are optimized for high-speed data access.

## Generating Short URLs
For large-scale systems, the service should generate short URLs in a way that minimizes collisions (different original URLs being shortened to the same URL). A common approach is to generate a unique ID for every long URL, and then convert this unique ID to a base62 (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) string. The unique ID can be an auto-incrementing primary key of the SQL database.

If you want to avoid predictability of URLs, instead of an auto-incrementing primary key, you could use a function that generates a random 64-bit number.

## Data Expiration
Deleting the expired URLs from the system is a challenge for a large-scale system. A background job could periodically scan the database for expired URLs and delete them. However, as the data size grows, this will become slower and more resource-intensive.

To optimize, one could use Time-To-Live (TTL) based data stores like Redis or DynamoDB that automatically delete data after a certain period.

## Analytics
A separate data store could be used to capture analytical information, such as the number of times each URL has been accessed. This data store might require a different access pattern (write-heavy) compared to the primary data store (read-heavy), and can be optimized accordingly.

## High Availability
Replication at each level (load balancers, application servers, databases) should be considered to ensure high availability and failover support. The system should be robust enough to handle the failure of any component.

## Security and Rate Limiting
To prevent abuse, rate limiting should be applied per client IP address or user account. A secure method of generating URLs should be employed to avoid any potential security vulnerabilities.

This is still a high-level approach. Depending on the specific use case and requirements, the system design can have other components and considerations. It is essential to keep scalability, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness in mind while designing such large-scale systems.








example

Sure, let's take a comprehensive example and design a URL shortening service such as TinyURL or bit.ly:

### System components

Let's assume our system has the following key components:

1. **UI**: The user interface where users can enter URLs they want to shorten.
2. **Backend API**: The server that handles requests from the UI, interacts with the database, and returns responses.
3. **Database**: Stores original and shortened URLs, along with any other relevant information (e.g., creation time, expiration time, number of times accessed).
4. **Cache**: Stores a subset of the database content to serve frequent queries faster.
5. **Background Worker**: Deletes expired URLs and calculates analytics.

Now, let's walk through the main operations:

### Shortening a URL

1. A user enters a URL, `https://www.example.com/my-very-long-url`, into the UI.
2. The UI makes a POST request to the Backend API, sending the long URL.
3. The Backend API generates a short path. This could be done by creating a unique ID (like an auto-incrementing primary key) for each new URL, and then converting this ID into a base62 string.
4. The Backend API checks if this short path is already in use (if users can select custom paths, collisions might occur). If the path is already taken, it goes back to step 3 and generates a new one.
5. The Backend API saves a new record in the database, with the original URL, the shortened path, and an expiration date (default or user-specified).
6. The Backend API returns the shortened URL (`https://www.tny.com/abcd123`) to the UI, which displays it to the user.

### Redirecting to the original URL

1. A user navigates to the shortened URL (`https://www.tny.com/abcd123`).
2. The Backend API receives a GET request with the path `abcd123`.
3. The Backend API looks up `abcd123` in the cache. If it's not present, it queries the database and adds the result to the cache.
4. The Backend API finds the corresponding record and checks if the URL has expired. If it has, it returns a 404 Not Found response.
5. If the URL has not expired, the Backend API increments a redirection counter for analytics purposes and redirects the user to the original URL (`https://www.example.com/my-very-long-url`).

### Running analytics and background tasks

1. A background worker runs at a regular interval (say, every hour).
2. It deletes records of expired URLs from the database and the cache.
3. It aggregates the number of accesses for each URL within the past hour and saves this data for analytics purposes.

### Extending the system

If the system needs to handle a high load, we can add load balancers in front of the Backend API servers and scale out our system horizontally. To further improve the system's performance, we can also consider implementing a distributed cache and a distributed database, or partitioning the database if one machine isn't able to handle all the data. If the redirection latency needs to be very low, we can consider setting up the Backend API servers globally and use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve the users from the nearest location. 

This is a basic example of how a URL shortening service could be designed considering all the given requirements. Remember that in real-world applications, systems can be more complex and require additional components or services based on various factors, including traffic load, data size, and specific user requirements.

Sure, let's continue on to some other details of our URL shortening service.

### Generation of Unique Keys

The service must generate a unique key for every URL. This unique key will be a part of the shortened URL. A common practice is to use an auto-incrementing primary key of the database record that stores the URL. If we convert this primary key to a base62 (a-zA-Z0-9) string, we will get a unique short string that can be our URL code.

Example: if our auto-incrementing ID is 125, and we convert it to base62, we get "21". Therefore, our short URL will be http://tny.com/21.

### Dealing with High Load and Redundancy

The load balancers can distribute incoming traffic to multiple servers containing our application. This not only helps to distribute load but also adds redundancy. If one server fails, the load balancer will route traffic to the remaining online servers.

Example: A good option for the load balancer might be HAProxy or Nginx.

### Caching

We can introduce a cache like Memcached or Redis to cache frequently accessed URLs to improve lookup performance. When a request comes in, we can first check if the URL is in the cache. If it's not, we fetch the data from the database and store it in the cache for future requests.

### Database Scaling

Depending on the amount of traffic and data, we may need to scale our database. We could do this by using database partitioning techniques, such as range-based partitioning or hash-based partitioning. 

For example, for range-based partitioning, we could store URLs starting from 'A' to 'M' in one database and from 'N' to 'Z' in another.

### Analytics

To track the analytics like the number of times a short URL has been used, we could increment a counter every time a redirection happens. We can have a background worker process that periodically aggregates this raw data and updates it in a database.

### REST APIs

To make our service accessible to other services, we can provide REST APIs. This enables other applications to automate short URL creation or fetch analytics data.

### Data Expiration and Cleanup

To handle the URL expiration, we can keep an "expiry date" field in the database and check it before redirection. Expired URLs can be cleaned up by a background service which regularly scans the database for expired URLs and removes them.

### Security and Privacy

To ensure that short URLs are not easily guessable, we should generate truly random and non-sequential URLs. Additionally, we might want to add some rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect our service from being overwhelmed by too many requests.

This is a broad overview of the system design. Note that the specific details and technologies used can vary based on requirements, load, budget, team expertise, and other factors.






how to scale further

Scaling this service further would depend on the specific bottlenecks that are observed, but here are a few general strategies that could be applied:

**1. Database Sharding:** As mentioned earlier, if the database becomes a bottleneck, you might consider sharding it. Sharding is a type of database partitioning that separates very large databases into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts called data shards. Sharding can be complex to implement and comes with its own set of challenges, such as handling transactions and joins, rebalancing shards, handling shard failures, etc.

**2. Replication:** Database replication can improve performance and ensure data availability. Replication can be in the form of master-slave replication (where the master serves writes and the slave serves reads) or master-master replication (where writes can be served by multiple nodes). Replication adds more complexity to the system, but can greatly improve read performance and availability.

**3. Load Balancing:** Introduce more load balancers or use more advanced load balancing strategies. Load balancers can be scaled up (more powerful machines) or out (more machines).

**4. Caching Improvements:** Cache hit rate can be critical for the performance of high-read systems. Ways to increase it include using a more intelligent caching algorithm, adding more cache servers, or by increasing the cache size.

**5. CDN (Content Delivery Network):** For global applications, latency can be reduced by serving content from the servers closest to the users. For this, a CDN can be used. This can be especially useful if the service has a lot of international traffic.

**6. Microservices:** Depending on the complexity of the service, breaking it up into smaller, more manageable pieces (microservices) can help with scaling. For instance, the URL generation, redirection, analytics, etc., could all be separate services. This adds complexity, especially in terms of service communication, but can make it easier to scale and develop the service.

**7. Autoscaling:** In a cloud environment, use autoscaling to dynamically adjust the number of servers based on the load.

**8. Optimizing Application Code:** Sometimes, the issue can be with the application code itself (inefficient algorithms, etc.). Profiling the application and removing these bottlenecks can improve performance.

Again, these are general strategies. The specifics will depend heavily on the exact situation, the current architecture, the nature of the traffic and data, the specific bottlenecks, the team's expertise, etc.








steps

Designing a large scale system like the URL shortening service involves several steps. Here are the main steps in the process:

1. **Requirement Gathering:** Understand and establish the functional and non-functional requirements of the system. In our case, these were already provided.

2. **System Interface Definition:** Define what APIs the system will expose. For our URL shortening service, we had two primary APIs - one for creating a short URL, and one for redirecting to the original URL.

3. **Back-of-the-Envelope Capacity Estimation:** Do some back-of-the-envelope calculations to estimate the scale of the system, which will drive the hardware and resources you'll need. For our service, we discussed the expected number of URLs, the storage requirements, and the network bandwidth required.

4. **Defining the Data Model:** Decide how data will be stored in the system. For the URL shortening service, we designed a simple table with fields for the original URL, the short URL code, the creation time, and the expiry time.

5. **High-Level Design:** Draw a block diagram of the system to visualize major components and how they interact. For our service, this included the client, the application server, the database, and the background worker for cleanup.

6. **Detailed Design:** Dive deeper into each component. For our URL shortening service, we discussed using a hash function to generate the short URL code, using a database for storage, using a cleanup worker to remove expired URLs, and strategies for handling duplicate URLs and custom URLs.

7. **Identifying and Resolving Bottlenecks:** Consider potential bottlenecks and limitations in the system, and think about how you might mitigate them. In our case, we talked about the potential for hash collisions, and how we might scale our database using techniques like sharding or replication.

8. **Scaling the System:** Think about how the system will handle increased load and how you can ensure high availability. For the URL shortening service, we discussed load balancing, database scaling, and caching, among other strategies.

9. **Security Considerations:** Evaluate how to keep the data and the system secure. For our URL shortening service, we discussed ensuring that the generated URLs are not predictable and restricting the ability to create custom URLs.

10. **Monitoring and Logging:** Plan how to monitor the system to track errors, system health, and other metrics, as well as how to log important events for troubleshooting or auditing purposes.

These are general steps, and depending on the specific system and requirements, there might be additional considerations. Also, remember that system design is an iterative process - you might need to cycle back to earlier steps as you uncover more information or challenges.






diagram

I'm an AI model and I'm not currently equipped with the ability to draw diagrams. However, I'll describe what the diagram of this system might look like, and you can draw it out based on the description.

1. **Users:** These are the entities that will interact with the system. They are on the far left of the diagram.

2. **Load Balancer:** The users interact with the system by sending requests to a Load Balancer. The Load Balancer distributes the incoming requests to multiple application servers to ensure the load is evenly distributed. This should be a block labeled "Load Balancer" to the right of the Users.

3. **Application Servers:** The Application Servers receive requests from the Load Balancer and perform the necessary processing. They interact with the Cache and the Database to store and retrieve data. These should be multiple blocks labeled "Application Server" arranged vertically to the right of the Load Balancer.

4. **Cache:** The Cache is a system that stores a subset of the Database in a faster-to-access manner. The Application Servers interact with the Cache before going to the Database to speed up common requests. This should be a block labeled "Cache" to the right of the Application Servers.

5. **Database:** The Database is the primary data storage system. The Application Servers interact with the Database to store and retrieve data. This should be a block labeled "Database" to the right of the Cache.

6. **Background Cleanup Worker:** The Background Cleanup Worker periodically deletes expired URLs from the Database. This should be a block labeled "Background Cleanup Worker" and have an arrow pointing to the Database, indicating it interacts with the Database.

7. **Analytics System:** The Analytics System collects and analyzes data about how the system is being used. There should be arrows coming from the Application Servers and the Database to the Analytics System to indicate they send data to it.

Remember to draw arrows between the components to indicate the flow of requests and data. The arrows typically go from left to right, with the Users initiating requests on the left and the requests flowing through the Load Balancer, Application Servers, Cache, and Database.

A properly drawn diagram should give a clear, high-level overview of how the different components of the system interact with each other.






flow diagram

As an AI text model, I don't have the capability to draw diagrams, but I can certainly describe the flow of requests:

1. A user sends a request to the system, maybe to shorten a URL or to access a short URL.

2. This request first hits the Load Balancer, which is responsible for evenly distributing incoming requests across multiple Application Servers. The Load Balancer uses some algorithm (like round robin, least connections, etc.) to decide which Application Server to route the request to.

3. The selected Application Server receives the request. If the request is to shorten a URL, the Application Server will generate a unique short code, save the original URL and the corresponding short code in the Database, and return the short code to the user. If the request is to access a short URL, the Application Server will look up the short code in the Cache.

4. If the Cache has the short code, the corresponding original URL is returned from the Cache and the Application Server redirects the user to the original URL.

5. If the Cache does not have the short code, the Application Server fetches the original URL from the Database and then redirects the user to the original URL.

6. After fetching the original URL from the Database, the Application Server will also add the short code and the original URL to the Cache to speed up future requests.

7. All requests and responses are logged and sent to the Analytics System.

8. The Background Cleanup Worker periodically wakes up and removes expired URLs from the Database.

Here's how you can represent the flow with arrows:

```
User ----> Load Balancer ----> Application Server ----> Cache
                                             |                ^
                                             V                |
                                             Database <---- Background Cleanup Worker
                                             |
                                             V
                                             Analytics System
```

Each arrow represents a request or response. Note that the interaction between the Application Server, Cache, and Database involves more back-and-forth communication.






basic algorithms

Sure, let's walk through the basic algorithms used for this URL shortening service:

1. **URL shortening**: Given a URL, we need to generate a short, unique alias for it. A common approach is to generate a hash of the URL and then encode this hash into a string that is used as the alias. One possible algorithm is MD5 or SHA256 for hashing, and then a Base62 (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) encoding of the hash to get the alias.

   Here is a pseudocode example:

   ```pseudo
   function generateShortLink(url):
       hash = sha256(url)
       shortLink = base62Encode(hash)
       return shortLink
   ```

   If a user requests a custom short link, we simply use that string as the alias instead, after checking that it's not already in use.

2. **Database insertion**: After generating the short alias, we need to store the mapping from the alias to the original URL in the database. We also store the expiration time.

   ```pseudo
   function storeLink(shortLink, url, expiry):
       database.insert(shortLink, url, expiry)
   ```

3. **Cache insertion**: To speed up lookups, we can also store the short-to-long mapping in a cache.

   ```pseudo
   function cacheLink(shortLink, url):
       cache.insert(shortLink, url)
   ```

4. **URL redirection**: When a user accesses a short link, we first look it up in the cache. If it's not there, we fetch it from the database and then store it in the cache.

   ```pseudo
   function getOriginalUrl(shortLink):
       url = cache.lookup(shortLink)
       if url is None:
           url = database.lookup(shortLink)
           cache.insert(shortLink, url)
       return url
   ```

5. **Cleanup of expired URLs**: A background process periodically scans the database for expired URLs and removes them.

   ```pseudo
   function cleanupExpiredUrls():
       expiredUrls = database.getExpiredUrls()
       for url in expiredUrls:
           database.delete(url)
           cache.delete(url)
   ```

Remember that these are high-level pseudocode examples. The actual implementation will depend on the specific database, cache, and programming language you're using.
