# Cricinfo

**Requirements**

1. The system should keep track of all cricket-playing teams and their
matches.
2. The system should show live ball-by-ball commentary of cricket
matches.
3. All international cricket rules should be followed.
4. Any team playing a tournament will announce a squad (a set of
players) for the tournament.
5. For each match, both teams will announce their playing-eleven from
the tournament squad.
6. The system should be able to record stats about players, matches, and
tournaments.
7. The system should be able to answer global stats queries like, “Who is
the highest wicket taker of all time?”, “Who has scored maximum
numbers of 100s in test matches?”, etc.
8. The system should keep track of all ODI, Test and T20 matches.

Sure, let's design the basic classes based on the requirements:

1. `CricketTeam`: This class will represent a cricket-playing team and should have details like team name, players in the team, matches played, etc.

2. `Player`: This class will represent a player and should have details like name, date of birth, batting statistics, bowling statistics, etc.

3. `Match`: This class will represent a cricket match and should contain details like the teams playing, scores, players, venue, date, etc.

4. `Tournament`: This class will represent a cricket tournament and should contain details like name, teams participating, matches, winner, etc.

5. `BallByBallCommentary`: This class represents the live commentary of each ball bowled during a match.

6. `Stats`: This class represents various cricket stats like total runs, wickets taken, centuries, etc. This data can be used to answer various statistical queries.

Here's a simple representation of these classes:

```python
class CricketTeam:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.players = []
        self.matches = []

class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, dob):
        self.name = name
        self.dob = dob
        self.batting_stats = {}
        self.bowling_stats = {}

class Match:
    def __init__(self, team1, team2, venue, date):
        self.team1 = team1
        self.team2 = team2
        self.venue = venue
        self.date = date
        self.scores = {}
        self.players = []

class Tournament:
    def __init__(self, name, teams, matches, winner):
        self.name = name
        self.teams = teams
        self.matches = matches
        self.winner = winner

class BallByBallCommentary:
    def __init__(self, match):
        self.match = match
        self.commentaries = []

class Stats:
    def __init__(self, player, match, runs, wickets):
        self.player = player
        self.match = match
        self.runs = runs
        self.wickets = wickets
```

Please note that in a production-grade system, the design would likely be more complex and involve additional classes and systems to handle various aspects like data persistence, performance optimization, error handling, and security.

Let's optimize the design of the ESPN Cricinfo system by adding more classes and methods, and improving the structure of our classes.

1. `CricketTeam`: This class represents a cricket-playing team.

2. `Player`: This class represents a player with personal details and performance stats.

3. `Match`: This class represents a cricket match with teams, players, and scores.

4. `Tournament`: This class represents a cricket tournament with participating teams, matches, and winners.

5. `Commentary`: This class represents the live commentary of each ball during a match.

6. `Statistic`: This class keeps track of various cricket stats which can be used to answer various statistical queries.

7. `Squad`: This class represents a squad selected by a team for a tournament.

8. `Performance`: This class captures the performance of a player in a match.

Here's the optimized class design:

```python
class CricketTeam:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.players = []
        self.matches = []

    def add_player(self, player):
        self.players.append(player)

    def remove_player(self, player):
        self.players.remove(player)

class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, dob):
        self.name = name
        self.dob = dob
        self.performance = []

    def update_performance(self, match_performance):
        self.performance.append(match_performance)

class Match:
    def __init__(self, team1, team2, venue, date):
        self.team1 = team1
        self.team2 = team2
        self.venue = venue
        self.date = date
        self.scores = []
        self.players = []
        self.commentary = Commentary(self)

class Tournament:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.teams = []
        self.matches = []
        self.winner = None
        self.squads = []

    def add_team(self, team):
        self.teams.append(team)

    def remove_team(self, team):
        self.teams.remove(team)

    def add_match(self, match):
        self.matches.append(match)

class Commentary:
    def __init__(self, match):
        self.match = match
        self.entries = []

    def add_entry(self, entry):
        self.entries.append(entry)

class Statistic:
    def __init__(self):
        self.entries = []

    def add_entry(self, player, match, runs, wickets):
        self.entries.append((player, match, runs, wickets))

class Squad:
    def __init__(self, team, players):
        self.team = team
        self.players = players

class Performance:
    def __init__(self, match, runs, wickets):
        self.match = match
        self.runs = runs
        self.wickets = wickets
```
This design now includes methods to add and remove players from teams, to update player performance, and to add and remove teams from tournaments. It also includes the `Squad` and `Performance` classes to better model the requirements. This is a much more robust and flexible design that allows for detailed tracking and manipulation of cricket match data. As with the previous design, this still represents a simplified view of a complex real-world system, and would likely need further refinement and expansion for a production-grade application.
