Data Structures and Algorithms with C++ STL

Compile and execute cpp files with g++ linux package in your linux machine or your WSL distro. I have created a function run() to use the g++ command along with std=c++17 compiler mode and then run the generated output file in the same terminal at the same time.
To use the run function, simply execute the shell script 'init_run_command.sh' to add the run function to .bashrc file and restart the bash. This will setup the run command.

Example (terminal):
run ds_master.cpp
