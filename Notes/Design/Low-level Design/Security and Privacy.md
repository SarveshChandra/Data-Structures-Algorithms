Security and privacy are crucial considerations in low-level design and should be integrated into the software development lifecycle from the start. 

**1. Security**

When designing a system, consider the following principles:

- **Least privilege**: Only grant necessary permissions and restrict access as much as possible. Each part of the system (e.g., process, user, program) should operate using the least set of privileges necessary to complete its function.

- **Defense in depth**: Layer your security controls. Rather than relying on one security measure, use multiple security measures that provide backup in case one fails.

- **Fail securely**: Handle errors securely. Design your system to fail without compromising security.

- **Security by obscurity is not enough**: Do not rely solely on hiding; security should not be compromised if design or source code is accessible by untrusted entities.

- **Keep security simple**: Security mechanisms should be as simple as possible. Complex designs increase the likelihood of errors and are harder to analyze.

- **Keep personal data secure**: Use encryption for storing and transmitting sensitive data. Hashing and salting should be used for storing passwords.

**2. Privacy**

When designing a system, you need to ensure that you're handling personal data responsibly:

- **Data Minimization**: Only collect the data you need.

- **Data Retention**: Only keep data for as long as you need it.

- **Consent**: Make sure you have permission to collect, store, and share personal data.

- **Transparency**: Be clear about what data you collect, why you collect it, and who has access to it.

- **Right to access/delete**: Users should be able to access their data and request deletion.

**Python Security and Privacy**

For Python, there are several libraries and techniques that can help you enforce security and privacy:

- **Cryptography**: The `cryptography` library offers cryptographic recipes and primitives. It can be used for symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing, secure comparisons, and more.

- **Secure connections**: Use `ssl` for establishing secure connections with TLS.

- **Secrets management**: Store secrets (API keys, credentials, etc.) securely. Don't hard-code them in your codebase. Pythonâ€™s `secrets` module is useful for generating secure random numbers for managing passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets.

- **Input Validation**: Always validate inputs to prevent injection attacks. For web applications, you can use frameworks like Django or Flask which provide protection against common attacks (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc.)

- **Privacy Libraries**: Libraries like `pandas` and `numpy` have started adding features to help with differential privacy, a technique to add noise to query results to protect individuals' identities while maintaining the statistical validity of the data.

Remember, there is no 100% secure system. Security and privacy are ongoing processes, and regular audits and updates are necessary to keep up with new vulnerabilities and threats.

Let's consider a simple web-based application in Python using Flask that stores and retrieves user credentials for the sake of the example. This should illustrate some key points about security and privacy in low-level design.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import os
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

app = Flask(__name__)

app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:////tmp/test.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password_hash = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)

    def check_password(self, password):
        return check_password_hash(self.password_hash, password)

@app.route('/create_user', methods=['POST'])
def create_user():
    data = request.get_json()
    username = data['username']
    password = data['password']
    hashed_password = generate_password_hash(password)
    new_user = User(username=username, password_hash=hashed_password)
    db.session.add(new_user)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"message": "user created"}), 201

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    data = request.get_json()
    username = data['username']
    password = data['password']
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
    if user and user.check_password(password):
        return jsonify({"message": "login successful"}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({"message": "bad credentials"}), 401

if __name__ == '__main__':
    db.create_all()
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Here's how this example relates to the security and privacy concepts:

1. **Security through hashing and salting**: We're using `generate_password_hash` from Werkzeug security to hash and salt the password. This way, even if our database gets compromised, the attacker would not have direct access to plain-text passwords.

2. **Least privilege**: Our database only stores hashed passwords and not the original ones. The only function that needs the original password is the `login` function, and the password isn't stored after that function completes.

3. **Secure connections**: While it's not shown in this example, in a real-world scenario, you'd want to serve your Flask application over HTTPS, not HTTP. This would involve using a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI and a reverse proxy like Nginx, and setting up SSL/TLS.

4. **Input validation**: We're not doing much of it in this example, but in a real-world application, you'd want to validate the inputs to your API endpoints to prevent injection attacks, and you'd want to confirm that the JSON data includes the expected fields before accessing them.

5. **Privacy through data minimization**: We're only storing the minimum amount of data necessary about the user: their username and hashed password.

Real-world applications would need additional security measures, such as rate limiting, JWT tokens for authenticating API requests, and more.

When it comes to security and privacy, there are several concerns to address, including data encryption, user authentication and authorization, input validation and sanitization, as well as protecting against common web vulnerabilities. Below are some advanced examples in Python focusing on these areas:

1. **Data Encryption using Python Cryptography Library**
The Python Cryptography library provides a robust set of tools for encrypting and decrypting data. Here's a simple example of symmetric encryption using Fernet:

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Generate a key
key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)

# Encrypt a message
data = b"secret message"
cipher_text = cipher_suite.encrypt(data)
print(cipher_text)

# Decrypt a message
plain_text = cipher_suite.decrypt(cipher_text)
print(plain_text)
```

2. **User Authentication and Authorization with Django**
Django's authentication framework is robust and can handle user authentication, sessions, permissions and user groups. Here's an example of how to check a user's authentication status and permissions:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required, permission_required

@login_required
def my_view(request):
    ...

@permission_required('polls.can_vote', login_url='/loginpage/')
def vote_view(request):
    ...
```

3. **Input Validation and Sanitization with Django Forms**
Django forms are a good way to handle input validation and sanitization. When a form is submitted, Django automatically cleans the data and runs validation steps.

```python
from django import forms

class ContactForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
    message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)

    def clean_message(self):
        message = self.cleaned_data.get('message', '')
        num_words = len(message.split())
        if num_words < 4:
            raise forms.ValidationError("Not enough words!")
        return message
```

4. **Preventing SQL Injection Attacks**
SQL injection is a common web security vulnerability. Django's ORM is designed to handle query parameterization for you to prevent SQL injection attacks. However, if you find yourself needing to write raw SQL queries, be sure to use parameterized queries instead of string formatting.

```python
from django.db import connection

def custom_sql(query, params):
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(query, params)
        results = cursor.fetchall()
    return results

# Usage: note that parameters are not included in the query string
custom_sql("SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column = %s", ['my_value'])
```

These are just a few examples of how to use Python and Django for secure programming. Security is a broad topic and requires careful design and coding practices, so it's important to continue learning and applying best practices to keep your applications secure.

Sure, let's look into some more advanced examples related to security in Python:

**1. Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection in Django:**

Django has built-in middleware for protection against Cross-Site Request Forgeries, which is an attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. 

You can enforce CSRF protection for particular views using the `csrf_protect` decorator:

```python
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_protect

@csrf_protect
def my_view(request):
    ...
```

**2. Password Hashing in Django:**

Storing users' passwords securely is an essential part of web application security. Django provides a flexible password storage system and uses PBKDF2 by default.

The `make_password` function can be used to create a hashed password, and `check_password` can verify a password against a hash.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.hashers import make_password, check_password

hashed_pw = make_password('my_password')
is_valid = check_password('my_password', hashed_pw)
```

**3. Django Permissions and Authorization:**

Django has a built-in permissions system that allows you to specify what actions users and groups of users can perform. 

```python
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required

@permission_required('polls.can_vote', login_url='/loginpage/')
def vote_view(request):
    ...
```

**4. Security Headers:**

Django allows you to manage various HTTP security headers using the `SecurityMiddleware`. Here are some of the security headers and their corresponding settings:

- Content Security Policy (CSP): `CSP_DEFAULT_SRC`
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS): `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS` and `SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS`
- X-Content-Type-Options: `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF`
- X-Frame-Options: `X_FRAME_OPTIONS`
  
You can add these settings to your Django settings file (`settings.py`).

**5. Advanced SQL Injection Protection with Django:**

While Django's ORM does a good job of preventing SQL injection attacks, you might need to write raw SQL queries sometimes. In these cases, it's essential to use parameterized queries and never use string formatting. Django provides the `params` argument in the `raw()` method for this purpose.

```python
MyModel.objects.raw('SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column = %s', ['my_value'])
```

Always keep in mind that maintaining security is not a one-time task but requires continuous learning, vigilance, and best practices.

Sure, let's dive deeper into more advanced security topics and Python examples:

**1. Input Validation**

Always validate user input to prevent common security issues, like SQL injection and XSS attacks. Python's built-in functions can be used for input validation. Here's an example of a simple email validation:

```python
import re

def validate_email(email):
    if not re.match(r"[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+", email):
        raise ValueError("Invalid email address")
```

**2. Secure File Uploads in Django**

File uploads are a common requirement, but they can pose a security risk if not handled properly. Here's how you can securely handle file uploads in Django:

```python
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

def validate_file_extension(value):
    if value.file.content_type != 'application/pdf':
        raise ValidationError(u'Only PDF files are allowed.')

class Upload(models.Model):
    file = models.FileField(upload_to='uploads/', validators=[validate_file_extension])
```

**3. HTTPS and SSL/TLS**

Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to secure the data in transit between the client and the server. Django doesn't handle SSL/TLS itself; it's typically handled by a separate web server or a reverse proxy in front of Django. However, Django can use the information about the connection security that these servers provide. Here's how to force HTTPS in Django:

```python
# In settings.py
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')
```

**4. Secret Key Management**

Don't hard-code secrets in your code. Use environment variables or dedicated secret management systems. Here's an example of how to load the secret key from an environment variable in Django:

```python
# In settings.py
import os
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('DJANGO_SECRET_KEY')
```

Remember that this is an extensive and ongoing field of study, and security needs can vary greatly depending on the specifics of your project. You should keep your knowledge up-to-date and regularly review your project for potential security issues.
