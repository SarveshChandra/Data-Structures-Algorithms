same seat.
12. Customers should be able to add a discount coupon to their payment.

Sure, let's go over the entities in our system:

1. `City`: Contains details of the city where affiliate cinemas are located.

2. `Cinema`: Contains details about the cinema, including its location (city) and a list of the cinema halls.

3. `Hall`: Represents a cinema hall in a particular cinema. It has a list of all seats and the movie currently being shown.

4. `Movie`: Contains information about the movie, including title, language, genre, and release date.

5. `Show`: Represents a particular screening of a movie. It contains details like the cinema hall, the start and end times, and the seats booked.

6. `Customer`: Contains customer details and methods to book tickets, select seats, and apply discount coupons.

7. `Seat`: Represents a seat in a cinema hall. It keeps track of its status (available or booked).

8. `Ticket`: Represents a movie ticket. It includes details like the customer, show, cinema, seats booked, and payment status.

9. `Payment`: Abstract class representing a payment. It has subclasses for each type of payment - CashPayment, CreditCardPayment.

10. `DiscountCoupon`: Represents a discount coupon that can be applied to a payment.

Here are the class definitions:

```python

    def book_ticket(self, show, seats):
        ticket = Ticket(self, show, seats)
        # Add ticket to database

    def apply_discount(self, ticket, discount_coupon):
        ticket.apply_discount(discount_coupon)

        self.row = row
        self.status = "Available"

    def __init__(self, customer, show, seats):
        self.customer = customer
        self.show = show
        self.seats = seats
        self.payment_status = "Pending"

    def apply_discount(self, discount_coupon):
        # Apply discount to payment

class Payment:
    def __init__(self, amount):
        self.amount = amount

    def make_payment(self):
        # Implement cash payment

        # Implement credit card payment

class DiscountCoupon:
    def __init__(self, code, discount):
        self.code = code
        self.discount = discount
```

This is a basic design and doesn't handle all edge cases. For example, in a real-world application, you would need to handle concurrency to ensure that no two customers can reserve the same seat. This might involve using locking or a transactional database to ensure atomic updates. You would also need to handle payment failures and network errors, and provide a way for customers to view their past bookings. Finally, you would need to secure the system to protect customers' payment information.

Handling edge cases in a real-world application often requires a mix of careful planning, thorough testing, and robust error handling. Here's how you might approach some of these edge cases for the movie ticket booking system:

1. **Concurrency**: When two or more users try to reserve the same seat at the same time, your system must prevent them from doing so. This could be achieved using a concept known as optimistic or pessimistic locking.

   - **Optimistic locking**: This involves recording which version of a record you're working with, and checking to make sure that no other transactions have modified the record before you commit your transaction. If the record has been modified, you abort your transaction and notify the user.
   
   - **Pessimistic locking**: This involves locking a record as soon as it's accessed in a transaction, preventing any other transactions from modifying it until the transaction is committed. 

2. **Payment failures**: In an online booking system, payment failures can be common. These can occur due to network errors, insufficient funds, incorrect credit card details, etc. Your system should handle these gracefully, ideally by providing useful feedback to the user and offering them a chance to try again with a different payment method.

3. **Network errors**: Network errors can occur at any time and cause various parts of your application to fail. You should anticipate these errors and build in retry mechanisms where appropriate. 

4. **Database errors**: If your application fails while writing to the database (for example, due to a constraint violation or a network error), you should ensure that the transaction is rolled back to avoid leaving the database in an inconsistent state.

5. **Security**: Security is another major consideration. User authentication and authorization should be enforced to prevent unauthorized actions. For sensitive data like credit card information, ensure to comply with industry standards and regulations such as PCI-DSS. Consider encrypting sensitive data both in transit and at rest.

6. **Data Validation**: Always validate data coming from users or other systems. This helps prevent errors, as well as security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection.

7. **Exception Handling**: Robust exception handling can prevent your application from crashing when something goes wrong. Instead, exceptions can be caught and logged, and the system can fail gracefully.

8. **Load Handling**: Your application might face high load situations during peak hours or during special events. Adequate measures should be taken to handle such situations. This may include using load balancing, horizontal scaling, caching, etc.

9. **Monitoring and alerting**: To handle any unforeseen issue, a monitoring and alerting system should be in place. It will allow the support team to proactively react to issues before they impact the users.

Remember, testing is key in detecting and handling edge cases. This includes not just unit tests and integration tests, but also load testing and security testing.

Here are examples of each edge case mentioned in the previous response:

1. **Concurrency**: Let's consider the movie ticket booking system. Two users attempt to book the last remaining seat at the same time. Without proper concurrency control, the system might end up accepting both bookings leading to overbooking. Proper implementation of optimistic or pessimistic locking can prevent this.

2. **Payment failures**: Suppose a user tries to book a ticket but their payment fails due to insufficient funds. The system should ideally notify the user about the payment failure and allow them to try another payment method or cancel the booking.

3. **Network errors**: Consider a scenario where a user is trying to book a ticket but the network connection drops in the middle of the transaction. A well-designed system should be able to handle this by either allowing the user to resume their transaction when the connection is restored or by rolling back the transaction completely.

4. **Database errors**: Let's say the system tries to save a booking into the database, but the operation fails because the database server is temporarily unavailable. The application should handle this gracefully, possibly by queuing the operation to be retried later, rather than crashing or losing the booking data.

5. **Security**: Consider a situation where an attacker tries to exploit a SQL injection vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to user data. Data validation and prepared statements can help prevent such attacks.

6. **Data Validation**: For example, a user might enter a future date as their date of birth. Proper data validation should catch this and ask the user to correct their input.

7. **Exception Handling**: Suppose a third-party service that the application relies on (such as a payment gateway) is down. Robust exception handling can catch the resulting exceptions, log them for investigation, and provide a fallback mechanism, such as allowing the user to pay by cash.

8. **Load Handling**: Let's consider a scenario where a popular new movie has just been released and there's a sudden surge in users trying to book tickets. Without proper load handling measures like load balancing or horizontal scaling, the application might crash due to the high load.

9. **Monitoring and alerting**: If the server's CPU usage goes beyond a certain threshold or if the application's response time is too high, a good monitoring and alerting system will immediately notify the support team about these issues so that they can be addressed before they impact too many users.
