# Blackjack and a deck of Cards

Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to obtain cards that add up to as near as possible to 21 without going over. They're playing against a dealer.

The main entities involved in the Blackjack game would be the `Card`, `Deck`, `Player`, `Dealer`, and `Game`.

Here's a brief description of each:

1. `Card`: This represents a standard playing card. Each card has a suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) and a value (2 through 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace).

2. `Deck`: This represents a deck of cards. It consists of 52 cards - 4 suits each with 13 values.

3. `Player`: The player can hit (draw a card), stand (stop drawing cards), or bust (exceed 21). 

4. `Dealer`: The dealer also draws cards similar to a player. However, the dealer follows a set of rules. They must hit if their hand totals 16 or less. They must stand if their hand totals 17 or more.

5. `Game`: This controls the progression of the game. It keeps track of the players, deals cards, and determines the winner.

In Python, the classes for `Card` and `Deck` could be designed as follows:

```python
class Card:
    def __init__(self, suit, value):
        self.suit = suit
        self.value = value

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.value} of {self.suit}"

class Deck:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = [Card(suit, value) for suit in ["Spades", "Clubs", "Hearts", "Diamonds"]
                                        for value in ["A", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K"]]

    def shuffle(self):
        random.shuffle(self.cards)

    def deal(self):
        return self.cards.pop()
```
In the `Card` class, we have a constructor that accepts a suit and value, and a `__repr__` method to display the card.

In the `Deck` class, we generate a deck of cards in the constructor, and provide methods to shuffle the deck and deal a card.

For the `Player`, `Dealer`, and `Game` classes, a simple implementation might look like:

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.hand = []

class Dealer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hand = []

class Game:
    def __init__(self, *players):
        self.dealer = Dealer()
        self.players = [Player(name) for name in players]
        self.deck = Deck()
```
Here, `Player` and `Dealer` are keeping track of their hand of cards, and `Game` is initializing the game with a dealer, players, and a shuffled deck. 

The methods for hitting, standing, calculating totals, checking for blackjack or bust, and determining the winner would need to be added to these classes.

Let's extend the game by adding methods to allow players to hit, stand, check for blackjack, and handle the dealer's actions:

```python
class Card:
    def __init__(self, suit, value):
        self.suit = suit
        self.value = value

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.value} of {self.suit}"


class Deck:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = [Card(suit, value) for suit in ["Spades", "Clubs", "Hearts", "Diamonds"]
                      for value in ["A", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K"]]
        self.shuffle()

    def shuffle(self):
        random.shuffle(self.cards)

    def deal(self):
        return self.cards.pop()


class Player:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.hand = []

    def hit(self, deck):
        self.hand.append(deck.deal())

    def get_hand_value(self):
        ace_count = sum(card.value == 'A' for card in self.hand)
        value = sum(int(card.value) if card.value not in ['J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'] else 10 for card in self.hand)
        while value > 21 and ace_count:
            value -= 10
            ace_count -= 1
        return value


class Dealer(Player):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Dealer")

    def play(self, deck):
        while self.get_hand_value() < 17:
            self.hit(deck)


class Game:
    def __init__(self, *players):
        self.dealer = Dealer()
        self.players = [Player(name) for name in players]
        self.deck = Deck()

    def play_round(self):
        # initial deal
        for _ in range(2):
            self.dealer.hit(self.deck)
            for player in self.players:
                player.hit(self.deck)
        print(f"Dealer's hand: {self.dealer.hand[0]} and ?")
        # player's turn
        for player in self.players:
            while True:
                print(f"{player.name}'s hand: {player.hand} total: {player.get_hand_value()}")
                action = input("Would you like to hit or stand? ").lower()
                if action == 'hit':
                    player.hit(self.deck)
                    if player.get_hand_value() > 21:
                        print(f"{player.name} busts!")
                        break
                else:
                    break
        # dealer's turn
        self.dealer.play(self.deck)
        print(f"Dealer's hand: {self.dealer.hand} total: {self.dealer.get_hand_value()}")
        if self.dealer.get_hand_value() > 21:
            print("Dealer busts! All remaining players win!")
            return
        # determine winner
        dealer_value = self.dealer.get_hand_value()
        for player in self.players:
            player_value = player.get_hand_value()
            if player_value > 21:
                continue
            if player_value > dealer_value:
                print(f"{player.name} wins!")
            elif player_value == dealer_value:
                print(f"{player.name} pushes.")
            else:
                print(f"{player.name} loses.")
```
This is a basic version of a blackjack game. Note that this is just a simple implementation, and it doesn't handle betting, splitting, doubling down, or insurance.

Also, this game will just play one round and then exit. If you want to play multiple rounds, you'll need to add some code to handle that, as well as handling the end of the deck (when all cards have been dealt). 

This code also doesn't have error checking for the user's input, so the game will crash if the user enters anything other than 'hit' or 'stand' when prompted. In a production-grade game, you'd want to add error checking to handle invalid inputs gracefully.

Designing a complete production-grade Blackjack game with advanced features like betting, splitting, doubling down, insurance, and multiple rounds is a complex task and beyond the capabilities of this platform to provide in full detail. However, I can give you some guidance and sample methods on how to implement some of these features:

1. **Betting**: You could add a `bet` attribute to the Player class, along with methods to handle betting, winning, and losing bets.

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, bankroll):
        self.name = name
        self.hand = []
        self.bankroll = bankroll

    def place_bet(self, amount):
        if amount > self.bankroll:
            raise ValueError("Bet exceeds bankroll!")
        self.bet = amount
        self.bankroll -= amount

    def win_bet(self):
        self.bankroll += self.bet * 2
        self.bet = 0

    def lose_bet(self):
        self.bet = 0
```

2. **Splitting**: To handle splitting, you would need to add a method to create a second hand if the player's first two cards have the same value. You'd then need to adjust your game logic to allow the player to play both hands separately.

```python
class Player:
    def split_hand(self):
        if len(self.hand) != 2 or self.hand[0].value != self.hand[1].value:
            raise ValueError("Cannot split hand!")
        self.second_hand = [self.hand.pop()]
```

3. **Doubling Down**: This could be implemented as a method that doubles the player's bet and deals them exactly one additional card.

```python
class Player:
    def double_down(self, deck):
        if self.bet > self.bankroll:
            raise ValueError("Cannot afford to double down!")
        self.bet *= 2
        self.hit(deck)
```

4. **Insurance**: This could be a method that allows the player to place an additional bet up to half of their original bet when the dealer shows an Ace. If the dealer has blackjack, the player wins the insurance bet.

```python
class Player:
    def place_insurance(self, amount):
        if amount > self.bet / 2:
            raise ValueError("Insurance bet cannot exceed half of original bet!")
        self.insurance = amount
        self.bankroll -= amount

class Game:
    def check_for_blackjack(self):
        if self.dealer.hand[0].value == 'A':
            for player in self.players:
                insurance_bet = input(f"{player.name}, would you like to place an insurance bet? ")
                player.place_insurance(int(insurance_bet))
        if self.dealer.get_hand_value() == 21:
            for player in self.players:
                player.bankroll += player.insurance * 2
```

5. **End of Deck & Multiple Rounds**: The Game class could keep track of how many rounds have been played and reshuffle the deck when necessary.

```python
class Game:
    def __init__(self, *players):
        self.dealer = Dealer()
        self.players = [Player(name, 100) for name in players]
        self.deck = Deck()
        self.rounds_played = 0

    def play_round(self):
        self.rounds_played += 1
        if self.rounds_played % 6 == 0:  # Reshuffle every 6 rounds
            self.deck = Deck()
```

6. **Error-checking for inputs**: You could add try/except blocks around places where you expect the user to input data to catch and handle errors.

```python
try:
    bet_amount =

 int(input("How much would you like to bet? "))
    player.place_bet(bet_amount)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input! Please enter a number.")
```

These are just starting points. You'd need to incorporate these into the main game loop and add additional logic to handle these features correctly. Always remember to test your code thoroughly to make sure everything works as expected.
