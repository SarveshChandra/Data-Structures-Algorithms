**Requirements**

1. Each member should be able to add information about their basic
profile, experiences, education, skills, and accomplishments.
2. Any user of our system should be able to search for other members
or companies by their name.
3. Members should be able to send or accept connection requests from
other members.
4. Any member will be able to request a recommendation from other
members.
5. The system should be able to show basic stats about a profile, like the
number of profile views, the total number of connections, and the
total number of search appearances of the profile.
6. Members should be able to create new posts to share with their
connections.
7. Members should be able to add comments to posts, as well as like or
share a post or comment.
8. Any member should be able to send messages to other members.
9. The system should send a notification to a member whenever there is
a new message, connection invitation or a comment on their post.
10. Members will be able to create a page for a Company and add job
postings.
11. Members should be able to create groups and join any group they
like.
12. Members should be able to follow other members or companies.

Here is an outline of the classes needed to create a LinkedIn-like system, according to your requirements:

1. **Member**: A class representing a user of the platform. It will contain information about the member and their activities on the platform.
2. **Profile**: Each Member has a Profile, which contains information about their basic profile, experiences, education, skills, and accomplishments.
3. **Company**: A class representing a company on the platform. A Company can have job postings.
4. **JobPosting**: Represents a job opportunity posted by a Company.
5. **Group**: Represents a community of Members.
6. **Post**: Represents a post made by a Member.
7. **Comment**: Represents a comment made on a Post.
8. **Message**: Represents a direct message sent from one Member to another.
9. **ConnectionRequest**: Represents a connection request sent from one Member to another.
10. **RecommendationRequest**: Represents a recommendation request sent from one Member to another.
11. **Notification**: Represents a notification sent to a Member regarding some activity on the platform.

These classes will be designed to interact with one another and handle the requested functionalities.

```python
class Member:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.profile = Profile(self)
        self.connections = set()
        self.posts = []
        self.groups = []
        self.messages = []
        self.notifications = []
        
    def add_experience(self, experience):
        self.profile.add_experience(experience)
    
    def search_members(self, name):
        # implement search functionality

    def send_connection_request(self, other_member):
        connection_request = ConnectionRequest(self, other_member)
        other_member.notifications.append(connection_request)
        
    def request_recommendation(self, other_member):

    def create_company_page(self, company_name):
        company = Company(company_name, self)
        return company
    
    def create_group(self, group_name):
        group = Group(group_name, self)
        self.groups.append(group)
        return group
    
    def follow(self, other_member):
        other_member.add_follower(self)

class Profile:
    def __init__(self, member):
        self.member = member
        self.experiences = []

    # similar methods for education, skills, accomplishments

        self.name = name
        self.admin = admin
        self.job_postings = []
    
    def add_job_posting(self, job_posting):
        self.job_postings.append(job_posting)

class JobPosting:
    def __init__(self, title, company):
        self.title = title
        self.company = company

class Group:
    def __init__(self, name, admin):

        self.admin = admin
        self.members = []

        self.likes = 0
        self.shares = 0
    
    def add_comment(self, member, content):
        comment = Comment(member, content

)
        self.comments.append(comment)

class Comment:
    def __init__(self, author, content):
        self.author = author
        self.content = content
        self.likes = 0
        self.shares = 0

class Message:

        self.sender = sender
        self.receiver = receiver
        self.content = content

class ConnectionRequest:
    def __init__(self, sender, receiver):
        self.sender = sender
        self.receiver = receiver

class RecommendationRequest:
    def __init__(self, sender, receiver):
        self.sender = sender
        self.receiver = receiver

class Notification:

        self.member = member
        self.content = content
```

Note: This is a simplified design and does not consider the persistence layer, error handling, and validation. Furthermore, in a real-world application, you would probably want to separate the concerns a bit more and not have classes like Member handle so much functionality.

In a more advanced or "production-grade" system, you'd likely want to introduce more abstraction, more classes, and additional systems to handle various aspects of the system, such as:

1. **User Management System**: to handle things like account creation, permissions, password resets, and account validation. This might involve classes like `UserManager`, `Account`, `Permissions`, etc.

2. **Search System**: A specialized subsystem (and associated classes) dedicated to providing efficient and accurate searching of members and companies. It may use data indexing techniques for faster retrieval of results.

3. **Notification System**: A system (and associated classes) dedicated to managing notifications. This might involve classes like `NotificationManager`, `EmailNotification`, `AppNotification`, etc.

4. **Message System**: A system (and associated classes) dedicated to managing direct messages between members.

5. **Data Persistence Layer**: Classes dedicated to managing the saving/loading of data to/from a database. This would involve database classes, classes to manage database connections, and possibly ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) classes.

6. **Security System**: A system (and associated classes) dedicated to maintaining the security of user data and transactions. This could involve classes like `SecurityManager`, `EncryptionService`, etc.

Here is an example of how some of these classes and systems might look:

```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self, member):
        self.member = member
        self.permissions = Permissions()

class Permissions:
    def __init__(self):
        self.can_post = True
        self.can_message = True
        # other permissions...

class UserManager:
    def create_account(self, member):
        account = Account(member)
        # save account to database
        return account

    def reset_password(self, account):
        # generate new password
        new_password = self.generate_password()
        # save new password to account in database
        return new_password

    def generate_password(self):
        # generate a secure random password
        return "new_password"

class SearchManager:
    def search_members(self, name):
        # query database for members matching name
        return []

    def search_companies(self, name):
        # query database for companies matching name
        return []

class NotificationManager:
    def send_notification(self, member, content):
        # check member's notification settings
        if member.settings.email_notifications:
            email = EmailNotification(member, content)
            email.send()
        if member.settings.app_notifications:
            app_notification = AppNotification(member, content)
            app_notification.send()

class EmailNotification:
    def __init__(self, member, content):
        self.member = member
        self.content = content

    def send(self):
        # send email to member

class AppNotification:
    def __init__(self, member, content):
        self.member = member
        self.content = content

    def send(self):
        # send app notification to member

class MessageManager:
    def send_message(self, sender, receiver, content):
        message = Message(sender, receiver, content)
        # save message to database
        # send notification to receiver
        return message
```

These additional layers of abstraction can make the codebase more complex, but they also make it more scalable and easier to manage as the system grows.
