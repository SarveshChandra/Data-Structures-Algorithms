    The reversed() function takes a sequence as input and returns an iterator that generates the elements of the sequence in reverse order. It can be used to iterate over a sequence in reverse order.

### min(), max(), sum():
    These functions take a sequence as input and return the minimum, maximum, or sum of the elements in the sequence, respectively.
    
### max(), min():
    These functions return the maximum and minimum value in an iterable, respectively.

### any(), all():
    These functions take a sequence as input and return True if any or all of the elements in the sequence satisfy a given condition, respectively.

### filter(), map():
    These functions take a sequence and a function as input and return a new sequence that is the result of filtering or mapping the elements of the input sequence using the given function.

### join():
    The join() method is a string method that takes a sequence of strings as input and returns a single string that is the concatenation of the input strings, with a specified delimiter between them.

### format():
    The format() method is a string method that can be used to format strings using placeholders for variables and other values.

### len():
    The len() function takes a sequence as input and returns the number of elements in the sequence.

### isinstance():
    The isinstance() function takes an object and a class as input and returns True if the object is an instance of the class, and False otherwise. It can be used to check the type of an object, which can be useful for type checking and error handling.

### type():
    The type() function takes an object as input and returns the type of the object.

### set():
    The set() function takes a sequence as input and returns a set, which is an unordered collection of unique elements. It can be used to remove duplicates from a sequence or to perform set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

### dict():
    The dict() function creates a dictionary, which is a collection of key-value pairs. It can be used to create dictionaries from sequences or to convert other data types to dictionaries.

### chr(), ord():
    The chr() function takes an integer as input and returns the corresponding Unicode character, while the ord() function takes a character as input and returns the corresponding Unicode code point.

### abs():
    The abs() function takes a number as input and returns its absolute value.

### round():
    The round() function takes a number and an optional number of decimal places as input and returns the number rounded to the specified number of decimal places.

### input(), print():
    These functions are used for input and output, respectively. The input() function prompts the user to enter a value, while the print() function outputs a value to the console.

### open(), read(), write():
    These functions are used for file input and output. The open() function is used to open a file, while the read() and write() functions are used to read and write data to the file.

### bin(), hex(), oct():
    These functions take an integer as input and return a string representation of the number in binary, hexadecimal, or octal format, respectively.

### format():
    The format() method can be used to format strings in a variety of ways, including specifying the width and precision of numeric values, and converting values to different bases.

### slice():
    The slice() function takes a start index, an end index, and an optional step size as input, and returns a slice object that can be used to slice a sequence.

### sorted(), reversed():
    These functions were previously mentioned, but it's worth noting that they can be used with any iterable, not just sequences.

### zip_longest():
    This function is similar to zip(), but it takes any number of iterables as input and returns an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. If the iterables are not of the same length, the missing values are filled in with a specified fill value.

### filterfalse():
    This function takes a function and an iterable as input, and returns an iterator that generates the elements of the iterable for which the function returns False.

### product():
    This function takes one or more iterables as input and returns an iterator that generates the cartesian product of the iterables.

### combinations(), permutations():
    These functions take an iterable and a length as input, and return an iterator that generates all possible combinations or permutations of the elements in the iterable of the specified length.

### allclose(), isclose():
    These functions are used for comparing floating-point numbers for equality. The allclose() function returns True if all of the corresponding elements in two arrays are equal within a specified tolerance, while the isclose() function returns an array of booleans indicating whether the corresponding elements in two arrays are close within a specified tolerance.

### assert():
    The assert() statement takes an expression as input and raises an AssertionError if the expression evaluates to False. It can be used for error checking and debugging.

### any():
    The any() function takes an iterable as input and returns True if any of the elements in the iterable evaluate to True, and False otherwise.

### all():
    The all() function takes an iterable as input and returns True if all of the elements in the iterable evaluate to True, and False otherwise.

### enumerate():
    The enumerate() function takes an iterable as input and returns an iterator that generates pairs of indices and elements in tuple data type from the iterable.

### sum():
    The sum() function takes an iterable of numbers as input and returns the sum of the numbers.

### binascii():
    The binascii module provides functions for converting between binary and ASCII data, including functions for converting binary data to and from various encodings, such as hexadecimal and base64.

### heapq():
    The heapq module provides functions for working with heaps, which are binary trees that satisfy the heap property (i.e., the key of each node is greater than or equal to the keys of its children). These functions include functions for converting a list to a heap, for inserting and popping elements from a heap, and for merging multiple heaps.

### itertools.groupby():
    This function takes an iterable and a key function as input, and returns an iterator that generates pairs of keys and groups of elements from the iterable that have the same key.

### bisect():
    The bisect module provides functions for working with sorted sequences, including functions for finding the position where an element should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, and for performing binary search on a sorted sequence.

### hashlib():
    The hashlib module provides functions for generating cryptographic hash functions, such as SHA-1 and MD5. These hash functions can be used for data integrity checking and password hashing.
