# Caching

Sure, caching is a very important concept in system design. It significantly impacts the scalability, performance, and efficiency of systems. 

**Caching** is the process of storing copies of data in a cache, which is a temporary storage area. The data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere. A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it cannot.

### How to Use Caching

Implementing caching in a large-scale production environment requires careful planning and consideration. Here are the key steps to use caching effectively:

1. **Identify the Needs for Caching:**

Firstly, identify what needs to be cached. Caching is often used to reduce latency, lighten database load, and improve system performance. Usually, data that's frequently accessed and seldom updated is a good candidate for caching.

2. **Choose the Right Caching Strategy:**

Choose a caching strategy based on your system's requirements. Some popular strategies include Cache-Aside, Read-Through, Write-Through, and Write-Back. Each has its own advantages and trade-offs, so choose one that aligns best with your system's needs.

3. **Select a Caching System:**

Choose a caching system suitable for your needs. There are numerous caching systems available like Memcached, Redis, Varnish, and many more. The choice depends on various factors like the nature of data, type of operations, consistency requirements, and so on. 

4. **Determine the Cache Size:**

The size of the cache should be determined based on your application's needs and the hardware constraints. An oversized cache can lead to a waste of resources, while an undersized cache might not effectively reduce the load on your database or backend.

5. **Implement Cache Eviction Policies:**

Implement a cache eviction policy that fits your use case. Common policies include LRU (Least Recently Used), LFU (Least Frequently Used), and FIFO (First In First Out). The choice depends on your application's access patterns.

6. **Cache Invalidation:**

Decide on a strategy for cache invalidation. If the data in the cache is stale, it should be updated or invalidated. This is crucial to maintain data consistency across the cache and the database.

7. **Implement Distributed Caching (if necessary):**

If your application is large and distributed across different geographical locations, you might want to consider implementing distributed caching. Distributed caches can offer fast data access, scalability, and resilience.

8. **Monitor Your Cache:**

Monitor cache metrics to ensure it's serving its purpose. Some useful metrics to monitor include cache hit rate, cache miss rate, cache usage, and load on the database. Monitoring can help you fine-tune your caching strategy.

9. **Test the Caching Layer:**

Perform rigorous testing to ensure that your cache works as expected and improves system performance. Be sure to test how your application behaves when the cache is cold (just started and empty), warm (partially filled), and hot (fully operational).

10. **Iterate and Improve:**

Based on the observations from monitoring and testing, you may need to adjust your caching strategy, size, eviction policies, and other factors.

Remember, caching can vastly improve the performance of your system, but it is not a silver bullet. It should be a part of a broader strategy to improve system performance and reliability.

### Types of Caching

Sure, let's delve into the different types of caching. Caching can be categorized based on where it is implemented in the system or how it is implemented. Here are some types:

**1. Client-side caching:**

Client-side caching is done on the user's device or browser. Web browsers, for instance, use this type of cache to store HTML pages, JavaScript files, images, and other components of a website. When a user revisits a webpage, the browser can load files from the cache instead of the original server, improving load speed. 

**2. Server-side caching:**

Server-side caching is done on the server. It can involve storing frequently returned results, such as database queries, in memory to speed up access. Some common server-side caching techniques include object caching, output caching, and database caching.

**3. Database caching:**

Database caching involves storing the results of a query directly in memory. This allows subsequent identical queries to return the stored data from cache, reducing the load on the database and improving speed.

**4. Content Delivery Network (CDN) caching:**

A CDN is a network of geographically distributed servers that work together to provide fast delivery of content over the internet. CDNs cache content on edge servers located close to users, reducing the distance that the content has to travel.

**5. Application Caching:**

This involves caching within the application. It can be implemented using various caching mechanisms like in-memory databases (e.g., Redis) or simply storing data in static variables.

**6. Distributed Caching:**

Distributed caching involves storing data across multiple nodes or hosts, often in a cluster. This type of cache can be accessed by multiple users in different locations. It can help enhance scalability and reliability.

**7. Web service and API caching:**

This form of caching involves storing the responses of common API calls. When a client makes a request that has been made before, the system can return the cached response instead of processing the request again.

**8. Hardware and Software Caching:**

Hardware cache is used in hardware to store data being transferred between components. A typical example is a CPU cache. Software caching, on the other hand, stores data on a disk or in memory to reduce computation time and increase the speed of data retrieval.

Each type of caching has its benefits and drawbacks, and the choice of which to use will depend on the specifics of the system being designed. Often, a combination of these caching types is used to maximize performance and efficiency.

### Main concepts related to caching:

**1. Cache Eviction Policies:**
   
When a cache is full, the system must choose to remove some items to make space for new ones. This is known as cache eviction. There are several popular policies for this:

- **Least Recently Used (LRU):** Discards the least recently used items first.
- **Most Recently Used (MRU):** Discards the most recently used items first. This is best for situations where the older an item is, the more likely it is to be accessed.
- **First In First Out (FIFO):** Discards the oldest data first.
- **Least Frequently Used (LFU):** Discards the least frequently used items first.

**2. Cache Types:**

There are several types of caches, each suitable for different kinds of applications:

- **Memory Cache:** This type of cache is stored in the main memory of a server and is faster than disk-based caches. An example of this is Memcached.

- **Database Cache:** Some databases have built-in caching capabilities. This cache stores the results of common queries to speed up future similar queries.

- **Web Server Cache:** Web servers can cache static content like CSS, JS, and images to speed up the response time for such requests.

- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** A CDN is a distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. It allows caching of data closer to the user, reducing the latency for serving such requests. It's often used for serving static resources for websites.

- **Browser Cache:** Browsers also cache a lot of information on the userâ€™s machine itself, such as cookies, files, and more.

**3. Write Policies:**

Caching systems also need to define how they handle writes:

- **Write-through cache:** The data is written into the cache and the corresponding database at the same time. This ensures data reliability but can increase latency for write operations.

- **Write-around cache:** The data is written directly to permanent storage, bypassing the cache. This can reduce the cache being flooded with write operations.

- **Write-back cache:** The data is written to cache alone, and completion is immediately confirmed to the client. The write to the permanent storage is done after certain intervals or under certain conditions. This results in low-latency and high-throughput for write-intensive applications.

**4. Cache Invalidation:**

If data is changed or updated on the main database, it should also be updated or invalidated in the cache. Otherwise, applications might use outdated (stale) data.

**5. Consistency:**

Maintaining consistency between cache and main memory/storage is a critical part of cache management. There are multiple strategies like write-through, write-around, write-back, as discussed above.

Overall, caching is a complex but crucial aspect of modern systems architecture, directly affecting the system's performance and efficiency. A well-implemented cache can vastly speed up data retrieval and provide a better experience for end-users.

### Aspects of caching.

**1. Locality of Reference:**

Caching takes advantage of the principle of locality of reference, which observes that a system tends to access the same set of resources repeatedly over short periods of time. There are two types of locality:

- **Temporal locality:** If a resource is accessed once, there's a high likelihood that it will be accessed again in the near future. Caching takes advantage of this by storing recently accessed data.

- **Spatial locality:** If one resource is accessed, there's a high likelihood that resources whose addresses are close by will be accessed soon. This principle is often used in disk caches or memory caches.

**2. Cold Cache vs Warm Cache vs Hot Cache:**

- **Cold cache:** A cache is called cold when it is empty, i.e., it doesn't contain any data. This is the state of a cache when it is first initialized.

- **Warm cache:** A cache is said to be warm when it contains some data but not yet the full data set that it can store. This state is usually reached after a cache has been used for some time.

- **Hot cache:** A cache is considered hot when it has been fully populated with data and the data it contains is frequently accessed. In this state, most requests result in cache hits.

**3. Cache Coherence:**

In a distributed system, multiple caches may store copies of the same data. This can lead to a problem known as cache incoherence, where different caches have different values for the same data.

To deal with this problem, systems can use various cache coherence protocols to ensure that all caches have a consistent view of the data. This is often done by invalidating or updating other caches when one cache changes the data.

**4. Caching Strategies:**

Here are some strategies to consider when implementing caching:

- **Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading):** Data is loaded into the cache on demand. When an application requests data, it first checks the cache. If the data is found, it's a cache hit, and data is returned from the cache. If the data is not found (cache miss), the application fetches the data from the main data store, stores it in the cache, and returns it. This avoids filling up the cache with unnecessary data.

- **Read-Through:** Data is loaded into the cache as part of standard read operations. The cache sits between the application and the data store. All read requests go through the cache. In case of a cache miss, the cache fetches the data from the data store, caches it, and returns it to the caller.

- **Write-Through:** Data is written into the cache and the data store at the same time. The cache sits between the application and the data store. All write requests go through the cache, ensuring that data in the cache is always up-to-date with the data store.

- **Write-Back (Write-Behind):** Data is written to the cache first and then to the data store. This reduces the latency of write operations, but there's a risk of data loss if the cache goes down before the data is written to the data store.

Caching is a powerful tool for optimizing system performance, but it requires careful design and consideration to be effective. It's also crucial to understand the trade-offs associated with the different cache strategies and choose the one that best suits your specific requirements.

### Distributed Caching:

In a distributed system, where the data and the users are spread across different locations, we need a method that can offer fast data access to users no matter where they are. A distributed cache is a solution to this problem.

In a distributed cache, the cache storage is spread across multiple nodes or servers, which can be located in different geographical locations. This architecture can greatly speed up data access because data can be read from or written to a nearby location.

Examples of distributed cache systems include Memcached and Redis.

**Memcached:**

Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data. It's simple yet powerful, offering high-performance, distributed memory object caching system. It was initially developed by Danga Interactive for LiveJournal but is now used by many other sites. Memcached's APIs provide a giant hash table distributed across multiple machines.

**Redis:**

Redis is another in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. Unlike Memcached, Redis supports a wide variety of data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and geospatial indexes with radius queries. It's a good choice when you need to perform complex operations on your cached data.

Distributed caching is an important aspect of system design that allows systems to scale while providing fast data access. It involves spreading the data cache across multiple nodes within a system, usually across a cluster of servers. This not only enhances data availability and reliability but also balances the load among the servers.

Here are some key aspects of distributed caching:

**1. Cache Partitioning:**

The basic concept of distributed caching is to split or partition the cache across multiple nodes. There are several strategies to do this:

- **Consistent Hashing:** This is a common approach for cache partitioning. In consistent hashing, the output range of a hash function forms a ring. Each server is assigned a point on the ring, and any incoming keys are hashed to a location on the ring. The data is stored on the server closest to the hashed point on the ring.

- **Key-Value Stores:** Many distributed caches use a key-value model for storing data. The client provides a key to the cache and receives the value associated with it.

**2. Data Replication:**

Data replication is another important aspect of distributed caching. This is when the same piece of data is stored in multiple locations (i.e., different servers). There are two main types of data replication:

- **Active Replication:** In this strategy, all updates to a data item are simultaneously forwarded to all replicas.

- **Passive Replication:** Here, updates are sent to a primary node, which forwards the update to backup nodes.

**3. Cache Synchronization:**

In a distributed caching system, keeping all the caches in sync can be a challenge. Common approaches to cache synchronization include:

- **Write-through Cache:** In this approach, data is written to the cache and the backing store location at the same time. This ensures that data in the cache is always up to date.

- **Write-back Cache:** Here, data is initially written only to the cache. The write to the backing store is done later, which reduces latency but carries the risk of data loss.

- **Cache Invalidation:** In this strategy, when data is written to one cache, other caches that hold this data invalidate their copies.

**4. Distributed Cache Systems:**

Several technologies exist for distributed caching, each with its unique features:

- **Memcached:** An open-source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system.

- **Redis:** An open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.

- **Hazelcast:** An open-source distributed in-memory data grid. It can be used for distributed caching, messaging, clustering, and processing data.

- **Apache Ignite:** A memory-centric distributed database, caching, and processing platform for transnational, analytical, and streaming workloads.

A well-implemented distributed cache can dramatically improve the performance of data retrieval operations and enable your application to scale to handle increased traffic. However, distributed caching can also introduce complexity and should be used judiciously based on specific needs and trade-offs.

### Best Practices for Caching:

When implementing caching in a system, there are several best practices to consider:

1. **Keep the cache consistent with the source of truth:** This means that whenever data changes in the database, the cache should also be updated or invalidated.

2. **Define a Cache Eviction Policy:** This policy will determine how your cache decides which items to remove when the cache is full and new data needs to be loaded.

3. **Size your cache correctly:** If your cache is too small, then it will frequently evict data, resulting in a lower hit rate. If it's too large, then you're wasting resources that could be used elsewhere.

4. **Don't store data that's not worth caching:** If data is rarely accessed or very short-lived, it might not be worth storing in the cache.

5. **Think about data serialization:** Depending on your application and cache solution, you may need to serialize your data before storing it in the cache. This can have a significant impact on performance, so choose your serialization strategy wisely.

6. **Use a layered caching approach:** For example, you can use a local cache for each application node, a distributed cache for sharing data between nodes, and a CDN for caching static resources close to users.

Caching, when implemented and managed properly, can significantly improve the performance and scalability of your system. However, it's important to remember that it is just one piece of the puzzle in building high-performing distributed systems.

Let's dive deeper into the concepts of Application Server Cache and Content Delivery Network (CDN).

### Application Server Cache

Application server cache refers to caching at the application layer, which is often located on the server-side. Here, data that's frequently accessed is cached in the application server memory to speed up the response time. In a multi-tier architecture, the application server can work in conjunction with a database and a client-side application to deliver and facilitate the exchange of data.

Some types of data that are often cached at the application server level include:

- Session data: This can include user credentials, cart items in an e-commerce application, user preferences, etc.

- Frequently queried data: This can include information that is queried often but changes infrequently, such as product categories in an e-commerce application.

- Computationally expensive data: This can include information that is time-consuming or resource-intensive to compute.

By storing this data in cache, the application server can quickly deliver the data without having to access the database or perform the computation again. This can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of an application. 

Technologies such as Redis, Memcached, and others are often used for implementing server-side caching.

### Content Delivery Network (CDN)

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of distributed servers that deliver content to a user based on their geographic location. When a user requests content (like a web page, image, video, etc.), the request is routed to the nearest server in the CDN, reducing latency.

Here's how CDNs work:

- **Caching at the Edge:** The CDN stores a cached version of your website content in multiple geographical locations, known as "points of presence" (PoPs). These PoPs contain their own caching servers and deliver content to users nearby.

- **Reducing Bandwidth:** CDNs can minify CSS, JavaScript, and other file types to shrink file sizes and conserve bandwidth.

- **Secure Delivery:** CDNs can provide security measures such as DDoS protection and SSL/TLS encryption to ensure safe content delivery.

- **Speed and Performance:** Since a CDN delivers content from the closest server to the user's location, it can greatly reduce latency and packet loss, improving site speed and performance.

Some popular CDN providers include Akamai, Cloudflare, Fastly, and Amazon CloudFront.

In summary, both application server caching and CDNs play a crucial role in improving application performance and user experience. While application server caching enhances performance by reducing the load on the server, CDNs focus on minimizing latency for end users scattered geographically. Together, they form essential components of a comprehensive caching strategy.

## QnAs

Certainly, here are some interview questions and their answers regarding caching:

**1. Question: What is caching, and why is it important in system design?**

Answer: Caching is a technique used to store copies of frequently accessed data in a location close to the requesting entity to reduce data access times. It's important in system design because it helps in improving system performance and scalability by reducing the load on the main server and decreasing data access latency.

**2. Question: Can you explain the difference between write-through, write-around and write-back cache?**

Answer: Write-through cache updates the cache and the backing store location at the same time. This leads to lower latency reads, but higher latency writes. Write-around cache updates the backing store but not the cache. This reduces the chance of a cache becoming filled with write data that may not subsequently be re-read, but reads can be slower if the data is not in cache. Write-back cache only updates the cache with write data, the write to the backing store is delayed until the cache blocks are replaced. This can result in faster write operations but there is a risk of data loss in case of a crash before the data is written to the backing store.

**3. Question: What is cache eviction and which policies are commonly used?**

Answer: Cache eviction is the process of deciding which items to remove from the cache when it is full. Common policies include Least Recently Used (LRU), where the least recently accessed item is evicted; First In, First Out (FIFO), where the oldest item is evicted; and Least Frequently Used (LFU), where the least often accessed item is evicted. 

**4. Question: What are the benefits and drawbacks of using a cache?**

Answer: Benefits include reduced latency, reduced load on the main server, and increased overall system performance. Drawbacks can include the complexity of maintaining cache consistency, especially in distributed systems, the potential for stale data if not properly managed, and the additional infrastructure cost of maintaining a caching layer.

**5. Question: What factors would you consider when deciding what to cache?**

Answer: Factors to consider might include: the cost of regenerating or fetching the data, how often the data is accessed, how much the data changes (with more static data being more suitable for caching), and the impact of serving stale data (if it's acceptable, caching becomes more attractive). The size of the data might also be a consideration, especially in systems with limited cache size. 

**6. Question: What is cache coherency and how can it be maintained in a distributed system?**

Answer: Cache coherency refers to the consistency of shared resource data in multiple cache locations. In a distributed system, maintaining cache coherency often involves implementing a strategy to ensure that when data is updated, all cached copies of the data are also updated (or invalidated). Strategies can include write-through or write-back cache, cache invalidation protocols, or even distributed caching solutions like Memcached or Redis. 

**7. Question: How can caching lead to a stale data problem? How can you prevent it?**

Answer: Stale data is data that is outdated and does not reflect the current true values. This can occur in a cache when the underlying data source is updated but the cache is not. To prevent this, cache invalidation strategies are used to ensure that cached data is updated or removed when the data source is changed. These strategies can include polling, TTL-based invalidation, write-through or write-back policies, and event-driven invalidation.

Sure, here are some more potential interview questions and answers related to caching:

**1. Question: What are the differences between a cache hit and a cache miss?**

Answer: A cache hit occurs when the requested data is found in the cache. A cache miss, on the other hand, occurs when the requested data is not found in the cache, necessitating a fetch from the backing store. The efficiency of a cache is often measured by its hit rate (the percentage of accesses that result in a hit) and its miss rate (the percentage of accesses that result in a miss).

**2. Question: What's the difference between local caching and distributed caching?**

Answer: Local caching refers to storing cached data on the same machine or process that is consuming the data, while distributed caching involves storing cached data across multiple nodes or systems in a network, allowing multiple clients or servers to access and share the cache. Local caching is simpler but can lead to cache duplication and inconsistency across nodes. Distributed caching is more complex but provides greater capacity and avoids the issues of duplication and inconsistency.

**3. Question: Explain what a Content Delivery Network (CDN) is and how it relates to caching.**

Answer: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and data centers that work together to provide high availability and performance. CDNs serve a large portion of Internet content today, including web objects (text, graphics, scripts), downloadable objects (media files, software, documents), applications, and other components of internet delivery. The key principle of a CDN is caching - most CDNs serve content from cache, and only fetch content from the origin server when the cache expires or when the content is not in the cache.

**4. Question: Can you discuss some popular caching systems and where they are typically used?**

Answer: Memcached and Redis are two popular in-memory caching systems. Memcached is often used for caching results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering. Redis, while it can do all that Memcached can, also supports data structures such as lists, sets, and hashes, and offers features like replication, persistence, and Lua scripting. Varnish is a popular HTTP cache used to speed up web applications by caching content in memory. CDNs like Cloudflare and Akamai are used for caching and serving static resources close to the user's geographic location.

**5. Question: What does 'cache warming' mean?**

Answer: Cache warming is the process of loading data into the cache prior to its use. This can be particularly useful in cases where a cache has been purged or invalidated, such as after a system restart or a cache failure. By warming the cache (that is, preloading it with the relevant data), you can ensure that the system continues to provide fast responses, instead of suffering a temporary performance penalty while the cache repopulates. 

**6. Question: How do Time-to-live (TTL) values affect a caching strategy?**

Answer: Time-to-live (TTL) is a mechanism that determines how long data should be stored in a cache before being automatically removed. This can help ensure that data in the cache does not become too stale. If the TTL is too short, it might lead to frequent cache misses and increased load on the backend services; if it is too long, the cache might serve stale data. Hence, choosing an appropriate TTL is a key part of a caching strategy.

Absolutely, here are some more potential interview questions and answers related to caching:

**1. Question: How does caching help in database scaling?**

Answer: Caching helps in database scaling by reducing the load on the database. Frequently accessed data is stored in the cache, so that future requests for the same data can be served directly from the cache instead of hitting the database. This can greatly reduce the number of read operations on the database, allowing it to handle more write operations and/or serve more users.

**2. Question: Can you discuss the term "cache poisoning" and how it could be a security concern?**

Answer: Cache poisoning refers to the act of inserting malicious data into a cache. An attacker could use this method to cause a service to return incorrect results, redirect traffic, or perform other malicious activities. To mitigate this, services can use techniques such as validating input, using secure cache update mechanisms, and regularly clearing the cache.

**3. Question: What does "cache busting" mean?**

Answer: Cache busting is a technique used to prevent browsers or intermediaries (like CDNs) from serving outdated or stale cached content. This is typically achieved by adding a unique identifier like a version number or timestamp to the URLs of the content (like CSS or JavaScript files). When the content is updated, the identifier changes, making the URL unique and forcing the browser or CDN to fetch the updated content instead of serving the old content from cache.

**4. Question: Can caching be applied at multiple levels in a system? Can you give some examples?**

Answer: Yes, caching can be applied at multiple levels in a system. For example, in a typical web application stack, you could have a CDN caching static assets at the edge locations, an in-memory cache like Redis or Memcached on the application server to cache frequently accessed data, and query-level cache in the database to cache results of frequent queries.

**5. Question: What are idempotent and safe methods in HTTP? How do they relate to caching?**

Answer: In HTTP, methods are considered idempotent if the result of performing the same request multiple times is the same as if it were made just once. GET, PUT, and DELETE are idempotent methods. Safe methods are HTTP methods that do not modify resources. GET and HEAD are examples of safe methods. Safe methods can be cached as they don't change the state of the resource, and idempotent methods can also be helpful in caching because repeating them doesn't change the outcome.

**6. Question: What is the purpose of ETag and If-None-Match headers in HTTP caching?**

Answer: ETag and If-None-Match headers are used for cache validation to determine if a resource in the clientâ€™s cache matches the one on the origin server. ETag is a response header returned by the server to define the state of a resource. The client can then use the If-None-Match header with the ETag value to ask the server if the resource has changed. If the resource hasnâ€™t changed, the server returns a 304 Not Modified status, saving the need to send the resource again.

Sure, here are more potential interview questions and answers related to caching:

**1. Question: How would you handle cache eviction?**

Answer: Cache eviction policies decide which items to remove from the cache when the cache is full and new items need to be added. There are several strategies for cache eviction, some of which include:
- Least Recently Used (LRU): This policy evicts the least recently used items first.
- First In, First Out (FIFO): This policy evicts items in the order they were added.
- Least Frequently Used (LFU): This policy evicts the least frequently used items first.
The right policy depends on the specific use case and the access patterns of the data.

**2. Question: What do you understand by cache coherence?**

Answer: Cache coherence refers to the consistency of shared resource data in multiple cache locations. When multiple copies of the same data are cached in different places, such as in a distributed system, it's important to have a strategy for ensuring that all caches have the most recent version of the data, i.e., they are coherent. This typically involves using a coherence protocol that defines how to handle reads and writes to shared data.

**3. Question: How does a write-through cache work?**

Answer: In a write-through cache, data is simultaneously written into the cache and the corresponding database or storage system. This ensures that data in the cache is always up to date with the database, but it may result in higher latency for write operations because a write is only considered complete when it has been written to both the cache and the database.

**4. Question: How does a write-back cache work and how does it differ from a write-through cache?**

Answer: In a write-back cache, data is initially written only to the cache. The write to the corresponding database or storage system is done later, often in batches. This can result in lower latency for write operations because a write is considered complete as soon as it is written to the cache. However, there is a risk of data loss if the cache data has not yet been written back to the database and the cache fails. The main difference from a write-through cache is the timing of the write to the database: immediate in write-through caching and delayed in write-back caching.

**5. Question: What is a cache stampede and how would you prevent it?**

Answer: A cache stampede, also known as cache thrashing, is a situation where multiple clients try to access a cache for a specific piece of data that has just expired, causing all the clients to attempt to regenerate the data and write it to the cache simultaneously. This can lead to a significant increase in the load on the system. One common way to prevent cache stampedes is by using a technique called "lock and compute", where the first client to request the expired data locks the cache entry and starts computing the new data, while other clients continue to read the old data until the new data is ready. Another approach is to randomize the expiration times of cache entries so that not all entries expire at once.
