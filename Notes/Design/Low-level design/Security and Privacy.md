Security and privacy are crucial considerations in low-level design and should be integrated into the software development lifecycle from the start. 

**1. Security**

When designing a system, consider the following principles:

- **Least privilege**: Only grant necessary permissions and restrict access as much as possible. Each part of the system (e.g., process, user, program) should operate using the least set of privileges necessary to complete its function.

- **Defense in depth**: Layer your security controls. Rather than relying on one security measure, use multiple security measures that provide backup in case one fails.

- **Fail securely**: Handle errors securely. Design your system to fail without compromising security.

- **Security by obscurity is not enough**: Do not rely solely on hiding; security should not be compromised if design or source code is accessible by untrusted entities.

- **Keep security simple**: Security mechanisms should be as simple as possible. Complex designs increase the likelihood of errors and are harder to analyze.

- **Keep personal data secure**: Use encryption for storing and transmitting sensitive data. Hashing and salting should be used for storing passwords.

**2. Privacy**

When designing a system, you need to ensure that you're handling personal data responsibly:

- **Data Minimization**: Only collect the data you need.

- **Data Retention**: Only keep data for as long as you need it.

- **Consent**: Make sure you have permission to collect, store, and share personal data.

- **Transparency**: Be clear about what data you collect, why you collect it, and who has access to it.

- **Right to access/delete**: Users should be able to access their data and request deletion.

**Python Security and Privacy**

For Python, there are several libraries and techniques that can help you enforce security and privacy:

- **Cryptography**: The `cryptography` library offers cryptographic recipes and primitives. It can be used for symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing, secure comparisons, and more.

- **Secure connections**: Use `ssl` for establishing secure connections with TLS.

- **Secrets management**: Store secrets (API keys, credentials, etc.) securely. Don't hard-code them in your codebase. Pythonâ€™s `secrets` module is useful for generating secure random numbers for managing passwords, account authentication, security tokens, and related secrets.

- **Input Validation**: Always validate inputs to prevent injection attacks. For web applications, you can use frameworks like Django or Flask which provide protection against common attacks (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc.)

- **Privacy Libraries**: Libraries like `pandas` and `numpy` have started adding features to help with differential privacy, a technique to add noise to query results to protect individuals' identities while maintaining the statistical validity of the data.

Remember, there is no 100% secure system. Security and privacy are ongoing processes, and regular audits and updates are necessary to keep up with new vulnerabilities and threats.

Let's consider a simple web-based application in Python using Flask that stores and retrieves user credentials for the sake of the example. This should illustrate some key points about security and privacy in low-level design.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import os
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

app = Flask(__name__)

app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:////tmp/test.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password_hash = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)

    def check_password(self, password):
        return check_password_hash(self.password_hash, password)

@app.route('/create_user', methods=['POST'])
def create_user():
    data = request.get_json()
    username = data['username']
    password = data['password']
    hashed_password = generate_password_hash(password)
    new_user = User(username=username, password_hash=hashed_password)
    db.session.add(new_user)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"message": "user created"}), 201

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    data = request.get_json()
    username = data['username']
    password = data['password']
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
    if user and user.check_password(password):
        return jsonify({"message": "login successful"}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({"message": "bad credentials"}), 401

if __name__ == '__main__':
    db.create_all()
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Here's how this example relates to the security and privacy concepts:

1. **Security through hashing and salting**: We're using `generate_password_hash` from Werkzeug security to hash and salt the password. This way, even if our database gets compromised, the attacker would not have direct access to plain-text passwords.

2. **Least privilege**: Our database only stores hashed passwords and not the original ones. The only function that needs the original password is the `login` function, and the password isn't stored after that function completes.

3. **Secure connections**: While it's not shown in this example, in a real-world scenario, you'd want to serve your Flask application over HTTPS, not HTTP. This would involve using a WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI and a reverse proxy like Nginx, and setting up SSL/TLS.

4. **Input validation**: We're not doing much of it in this example, but in a real-world application, you'd want to validate the inputs to your API endpoints to prevent injection attacks, and you'd want to confirm that the JSON data includes the expected fields before accessing them.

5. **Privacy through data minimization**: We're only storing the minimum amount of data necessary about the user: their username and hashed password.

Remember, this is a simplified example for illustrative purposes. Real-world applications would need additional security measures, such as rate limiting, JWT tokens for authenticating API requests, and more.
