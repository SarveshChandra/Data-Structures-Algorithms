**Can you name some metrics for measuring system performance?**

Interviewers may ask you this question to find out if you understand the different ways to
measure system performance and the importance of these monitoring techniques. When you
answer, explain how these metrics help ensure a fast and efficient system.

Example: "The three most common metrics used to measure a system's performance are
availability, latency and throughput. These metrics help system designers measure the speed of
a user's experience while interacting with a system. Availability shows us how often a system
responds to a user in a ratio of Uptime vs. Downtime. Latency refers to the speed at which a
message is delivered in milliseconds. Finally, throughput measures the amount of data that
successfully travels through a system to a user in a specified time period. Throughput is typically
calculated in bits per second."

**What is load balancing, and why is it important to system design?**

Your interviewer may ask this question to hear you explain one of the fundamental principles of
system design. It is important to prove your knowledge of this basic design function by clearly
stating how load balancing works and how it contributes to the reliability of a system.

Example: "Load balancing is the essential process of allocating tasks across computing nodes
to ensure the functionality of a system. The two main load balancers, L4 and L7, are named for
the OSI model of network communication.

Load balancing improves the quality of a design, using either hardware or software to create a
more reliable system. A system's load balance impacts system security and user experience. An
effective load balance also allows for continuous software updates and scaled server space to
accommodate changes in system use."
